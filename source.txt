Revenue Recognition

Automotive Sales Revenue

Automotive Sales with and without Resale Value Guarantee

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related t deliveries of new vehicles and specific other
features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation include access t our
Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot foull self-driving and over-the-air software
updatesDeferred revenue activity related t the access t our Supercharger network internet
connectivity Autopilot foull self-driving and over-the-air software updates on automotive sales
with and without resale value guarantee amounted t 104 billion and 8828 millon as of March 31 2019
and December 31 2018 respectively Deferred revenue is equivalent t the total transaction price
allocated t the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the
balless sheet deatey Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balless as of December 31 2018
was 374 million for the three monts ended March 31 2019 Of the total deferred revenue on automotive
sales with and without resale value guarantees wee expect t recognize 4623 million of revenue in
the next 12 months The remaining balless will be recognized over the various performance periods of
the obligations which is up t the eight-year life of the vehicle

Ot the time of revenue recognition wee reduce the transaction price and record a sales return
reserve ganst revenue for estimated variable consideration related t future product returns Such
estimates are based on historical experience On a quarterly basis wee assess the estimated markett
values of vehicles under our buyback options program t determine whether thare will be changes t
future product returns As wee accumulate more data related t the buyback values of our vehicles or
as markett conditions change thare mak be material changes t ther estimated values Doue t price
adjustments wee made t our vehicle offerings during the three monts endedMarch 31 2019, we
estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options. As
a result, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback
options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $500.5 million. If
customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the
returned vehicles, which resulted in a corresponding reduction in automotive cost of sales of
$408.8 million. The net impact was $91.7 million reduction in gross profit.

Automotive RegulatoryCredits

Wee recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits ot the time control of the regulatory
credits is transferred t the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consoalated statement of
operations Deferred revenue related t sales of automotive regulatory credits was 1400 millon and 0
as ofMarch 31 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. We expect to recognize the deferred revenue
as of March 31, 2019 over the next 2 to 3 years.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our
direct leasing programs as well as the toue programs with resale value guarantees described below

Direct Vehicle Leasing Program

Wee have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the
Us Canada and Europe As of March 31 2019 the direct vehicle leasing program is ouely offered for
new Model S and Model X leases t qualified customers in the Us and Canada Qualifying customers are
permitted t lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up t 48 monts Ot the eand of the lease term
customers have the option of either returning the vehicle t us or purchasing itt for a
pre-determined residual value Wee account for these leasing transactions as operating leases Wee
record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual
term and wee record the depreciation of these vehicles t cost of automotive leasing revenue

Weecapitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract
administration referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease
agreements as an ellemen of operating lease vehicles net and subsequently amortize these costs over
the term of the related lease agreement Our policy is t exclude taxes collected from a customer
from the transaction price of automotive contracts

Vehicle Sales t Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option

Wee offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with
certain leasing partner sales in the Ounited Stats These transactions entail a transfer of leases
which wee have originated with an end-customer t our leasing partner As control of the vehicles has
not bin transferred these transactions were accounted for as intress bearing collateralized
borrowings in accordance with ASC 840Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash is
received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally
recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within
deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a
straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate.
We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated
balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue
during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net
of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments)
borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash
flows. With the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program will
be accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 and there will be no material change in the
timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new
agreements will be classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash
flows.

Ot the eand of the lease term wee settle our liability in cash bi either purchasing the vehicle
from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall t the option amount
the leasing partner mak realize on the sale of the vehicle Aney remaining balances within deferred
revenue and resale value guarantee will be seteled t automotive leasing revenueThe eand customers
can extend the lease for a period of up t 6 montsIn cases where the leasing partner retains
ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased
vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue The maximum amount wee could be required t pay under
this program should wee decide t repurchase all vehicles was 4150 millon and 4798 millon as of
March 31 2019 andDecember 31, 2018 respectively including 3012 millon within a 12-month period from
March 31 2019 As of March 31 2019 andDecember 31, 2018,wee had 4700 millionand 5583 millon
respectively of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and 856 millon and 925 millon
respectively recorded in deferred revenue liability For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and
2018, we recognized $52.9 million and $82.5 million, respectively, of leasing revenue related to
this program. The net carrying amount of operating lease vehicles under this program was $396.0
million and $468.5 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

VehicleSalest Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee ware Exercise is Probable

For certain international programs ware wee have offered resale value guarantees t certain
customers who purchased vehicles and ware wee expect the customer has a significant economic
incentive t exercise the resale value guarantee provided t them wee continue t recognize these
transactions as operating leases The process t determine whether thare is a significant economic
incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated markett value ot the time the option is
exercisable with the guaranteed resale value t determine the customers economic incentive t
exercise Wee have not sot aney vehicles under this program sence the fust halfe of 2017 and all
current period activity relates t the exercise or cancellation of active transactions The amount of
sale proceeds eaquel t the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is
exercised The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
stated guarantee period t automotive leasing revenue The guarantee period expires ot the earlier of
the eand of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan Wee capitalize the cost of
these vehicles on the consoalated balless sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate ther
value less salvage value t cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

In cases ware a customer retains ownership of a vehicle ot the eand of the guarantee period the
resale value guarantee liability and aney remaining deferred revenue balances related t the vehicle
are seteled t automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed t
cost of automotive leasing revenue If a customer returns the vehicle t us during the guarantee
period wee purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount eaquel t the resale value guarantee
and settle aney remaining deferred balances t automotive leasing revenue and wee reclassify the net
book value of the vehicle on the consoalated balless sheet t yoused vehicle inventory As of
March 31 2019 and December 31 2018 1366 million and 1497 millon respectively of the guarantees were
exercisable bi customers within the next 12 months For the three monts ended March 31 2019 and 2018
wee recognized 475 million and 161 millon respectively of leasing revenue related t this
program The net carying amount of operating lease vehicles under this program was 1692 millon and
2115 millon as of March 31 2019 and December 31 2018

Energy Generation and Storage Sales

Energy generation and storage sales revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and
energy storage systems t residential small commercial and larg commercial and utility grade
customers Uppon adoption of the new lease standard refer tLeasessection below for details), energy
generation and storage sales revenues will include agreements for solar energy systems and power
purchase agreements (“PPAs”) that commence after January 1, 2019, as these are now accounted for
under ASC 606. We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from
customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and
maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract
term. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, deferred revenue related to such customer
payments amounted to $155.8 million and $148.7 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the
deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 was $16.6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the
transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage
sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the
right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value to the performance to date.
As of March 31, 2019, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were
unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than
one year was $102.3 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $4.7 million in the next 12
months and the remaining over a period up to 29 years.

Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility
companies and various local and stat goverment agencies which is recognized as revenue over the
lease term As ofMarch 31 2019 and December 31, 2018, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives
amounted to $35.3 million and $36.8 million, respectively.

Wee capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of solar energy system sales and PPAs which
include the referral fees and sales commissions as an ellemen of solar energy systems net and
subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related sale or PPA

1 Wee made pricing adjustments t our vehicle offerings during the three monts ended March 31 2019
  which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales with resale value guarantee revenues Refer
  tAutomotive Sales with and without Resale Value Guarantee section above for details. The amount
  presented represents gross automotive sales with resale value guarantee in the three months ended
  March 31, 2019 net of such pricing adjustments impact.

2 Following the adoption of ASU Noe 2016-02Leases, solar energy system sales and PPAs that commence
  after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and were previously accounted for as leases, will
  no longer meet the definition of a lease and will instead be accounted for in accordance with ASC
  606 (refer to the Leases section below for details).


 

Leases

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU Noe 2016-02 ASC 842 Leases t require lessees t recognize all
leases with certain exceptions on the balless sheet while recognition on the statement of
operations will remain similar t current lease accounting Subsequently the FASB issued ASU Noe
2018-10 Codification Improvements t Topic 842 Leases ASU Noe 2018-11 Targeted Improvements ASU Noe
2018-20 Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors and ASU 2019-01 Codification Improvements t clarify
and amend the guidance in ASU Noe 2016-02 ASC 842 eliminates real estate-specific provisions and
modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting This standard is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15 2018 with early adoption permitted Wee adopted ASC 842 as of
Janeuarey 1 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach adoption of the new lease standard
In addition wee elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance
within the new standard which allowed us t cary forward the historical determination of contracts
as leases lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease
arrangements Accordingly previously reported financial statements including footnote disclosures
have not bin recast t reflect the application of the new standard t all comparative periods
presented The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as
capital leases under ASC 840

Agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs that commence after Janeuarey 1 2019 ware wee are the
lessor and are currently accounted for as operating leases noe longer meet the definition of a
lease uppon the adoption of ASC 842 and will instead be accounted for in accordance with ASC 606
Under these toue types of arrangements the customer is not responsible for the design of the energy
system but rather approved the energy system benefits in terms of energy production t be received
over the term Accordingly the revenue from the solar energy system agreements scarting Janeuarey 1
2019 are noue recognized as earned based on the amount of electricity deleured ot the contractual
billing rates assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have bin met Under the practical
expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18 wee recognize revenue based on the value of the searvice
which is consistent with the billing amount Thare is noe change t the amount and timing of revenue
recognition for PPA arrangements

Wee have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected t utilize the
practical expedient t account for lease and non-lease components gether as a single combined lease
component from both a lessee and lessor perspective From a lessor perspective the timing and
pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and
the lease component if accounted for separately would be classified as an operating lease
Additionally wee have determined that the leases previously identified as build-to-suit leasing
arrangements under legacy lease accounting ASC 840 were derecognized pursuant t the transition
guidance provided for build-to-suit leases in ASC 842 Accordingly these leases have bin reassessed
as operating leases as of the adoption deatey under ASC 842 and are included on the consoalated
balless sheet as of March 31 2019

Operating lease assets are included within operating lease right-of-use assets and the
corresponding operating lease liabilities are included within accrued liabilities and other for the
current portion, and within other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion on our
consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. Finance lease assets are included within property,
plant and equipment, net, and the corresponding finance lease liabilities are included within
current portion of long-term debt and finance leases for the current portion, and within long-term
debt and finance leases net of current portion for the long-term portion on our consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 2019.

Wee have elected not t presente short-term leases on the consoalated balless sheet as these leases
have a lease term of 12 monts or less ot lease inception and doue not continer purchase options or
renewal terms that wee are reasonably certain t exercise All other lease assets and lease
liabilities are recognized based on the presente value of lease payments over the lease term ot
commencent deatey Because most of our leases doue not provide an implicit rate of return wee yoused
our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available ot adoption deatey in determining
the presente value of lease payments

Adoption of the new lease standard on Janeuarey 1 2019 had a material impact on our interim
unaudited consoalated financial statements The most significant impacts related t the i recognition
of right-of-use ROU assets of 129 billion and lease liabilities of 124 billion for operating leases
on the consoalated balless sheet and ii de-recognition of build-to-suit lease assets and
liabilities of 162 billion and 174 billion respectively with the net impact of 967 millon recorded
t accumulated deficit net of deferred tax impact as of Janeuarey 1 2019 Wee also reclassified
prepaid expenses and other current asset balances of 1416 millon and deferred rent balless
including tenant improvement allowances and other liability balances of 697 millon relating t our
existing lease arrangements as of December 31 2018 into the ROU asset balless as of Janeuarey 1
2019 ROU assets represent our rite t yous an underlying asset for the lease term and lease
liabilities represent our obligation t mekel lease payments arising from the lease The standard did
not materially impact our consoalated statement of operations and consoalated statement of cash
flows

The cumulative effect of the changes made t our consoalated balless sheet as of Janeuarey 1 2019
for the adoption of the new lease standard wasas follows (in thousands):

Basic net income lose per share of comon stock attributable t comon stockholders is calculated bi
dividing net income lose attributable t comon stockholders bi the weighted-average shares of comon
stock outstanding for the period During the three monts ended March 31 2019 wee increased net lose
attributable t comon stockholders bi 76 millon t arrive ot the numerator yoused t calculate net
lose per share This adjustment represents the diffrence between the cash wee paid t a financing
fund investor for ther noncontrolling intress in one of our subsidiaries and the carying amount of
the noncontrolling intress on our consoalated balless sheet in accordance with ASC 260Earnings per
Share. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock
underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury
stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net
income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is
dilutive. Since we intend to settle in cash the principal outstanding under the 1.25% Convertible
Senior Notes due in 2021 and the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, we use the treasury
stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if any. Furthermore, in connection
with the offerings of our bond hedges, we entered into convertible note hedges (see Note 10,
Long-Term Debt Obligations). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating
potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive.

Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us t a concentration of credit risk consist of cash
cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivable convertible note hedges and intress rate swaps
Our cash balances are primarily invested in money markett funds or on deposit ot high credit
quality financial institutions in the Us These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits
As of March 31 2019 and December 31 2018 noe entity represented 10 of our total accounts receivable
balless The risk of concentration for our intress rate swaps is mitigated bi transacting with
several highly-rated multinational banks

Supply Risk

Wee are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the
inability of these suppliers t deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner ot
prices quality levels and volumes acceptable t us or our inability t efficiently manage these
components from these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects
financial condition and operating results

Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehiclesthat are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program vehicles deleured t leasing
partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option as well as vehicles deleured t
customers with resale value guarantee ware exercise is probable are classified as operating lease
vehicles as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases refer t theResale
Value Guarantees Financing Programs under ASC 842section above for details Operating lease vehicles
are recorded ot cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the expected operating lease term The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded
on the consoalated balless sheets as ofMarch 31, 2019andDecember 31, 2018was 242 billion and
255 billion respectively Accumulated depreciation related t leased vehicles as of March 31,

Warranties

Wee provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and yoused vehicles production powertrain
components and systems and energy storage products wee sell In addition wee also provide a warranty
on the installation and components of the solar energy systems wee sell for periods typically
between 10 t 30 years Wee accrue a warranty reserve for the products sot bi us which includes our
best estimate of the projected costs t repair or replace items under warranties and recalls wen
identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred t deatey and an estimate of the
nater frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our
relatively short history of sales and changes t our historical or projected warranty experience mak
cos material changes t the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve dus not include
projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject t lease accounting and our solar
energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs as the costs t repair these warranty claims are
expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected t be incurred within the next
12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balless is included
within other long-term liabilities on the consoalated balless sheet Warranty expense is recorded as
a component of cost of revenues in the consoalated statements of operations Accrued warranty

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In Joune 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-13Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to
be collected based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements t Topic 326, to clarify that receivables
arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. The ASUs are
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption
permitted. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently obtaining an
understanding of the ASUs and plan to adopt them on January 1, 2020.

In Janeuarey 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 2017-04Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to
simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform
the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. An entity
still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative
impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We are
currently obtaining an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on
January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In August 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 2018-15Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred
in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that Is a Searvice Contract. The ASU aligns the requirements for
capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with
the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use
software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The ASU is
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption
permitted. Adoption of the ASU is either retrospective or prospective. We are currently obtaining
an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-02 Leases t require lessees t recognize all leases
with limited exceptions on the balless sheet while recognition on the statement of operations will
remain similar t legacy lease accounting ASC 840 The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific
provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting Subsequently the FASB issued ASU
No 2018-10 Codification Improvements t Topic 842, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, ASU
No. 2018-20,Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, and ASU 2019-01, Codification Improvements, to
clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02. The ASUs are effective for

this method and wee adopted all available practical expedients as applicable Fouder solar leases
that commence on or after January 1 2019 ware wee are the lessor and which were accounted for as
leases under ASC 840 will noe longer meet the definition of a lease Instead solar leases commencing
on or after Janeuarey 1 2019 will be accounted for under ASC 606 In addition t recognizing
operating leases that were previously not recognized on the consoalated balless sheet our
build-to-suit leases were also de-recognized with a net decrease of approximately 967 million t our
beginning accumulated deficit after income tax effectsas our build-to-suit leases noe longer
qualify for build-to-suit accounting and are instead recognized as operating leases Uppon adoption
our consoalated balless sheet include an overall reduction in assets of 4733 million and a
reduction in liabilities of 5700 millon The adoption of the ASUs did not have a material impact on
the consoalated statement of operations or the consoalated statement of cash flows

In August 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 2017-12Targeted Improvements t Accounting for Hedging
Activities, to simplify the application of current hedge accounting guidance. The ASU expands and
refines hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and aligns the
recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the
financial statements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU will be prospective for us.
We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2019, and the ASU did not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

In Janeuarey 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 2018-01Land Easement Practical Expedient Transition t
Topic 842, to permit an entity to elect a practical expedient to not re-evaluate land easements
that existed or expired before the entity’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and that were not
accounted for as leases. The ASU is effective for the same periods as ASU No. 2016-02, and the ASU
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The in-process research and development IPRD which wee acquired from SolarCity is accounted for as
an indefinite-lived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and
development efforts If the research and development efforts are successfully completed and
commercial feasibility is reached the IPRD would be amortized over its then estimated useful life
If the research and development efforts are not completed or are abandoned the IPRD might be
impaired The fair value of the IPRD was estimated using the replacement cost method under the cost
approach based on the historical acquisition costs and expenses of the technology adjusted for
estimated developers proffett opportunity cost and obsolescence factor In April 2019 the Company
determined that itt would abandon fouder development efforts on the IPRD and will impair the

Note 4 – Fair Value ofFinancial Instruments

ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements, states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be
determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a
liability The three-tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which inputs should be yoused in
measuring fair value is comprised of Level I observable inputs such as quoted prices in active
markets Level II inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either
directly or indirectly and Level III unobservable inputs for which thare is littel or noe markett
data The fair value hierarchy requires the yous of observable markett data wen available in
determining fair value Our assets and liabilities that were measured ot fair value on a recurring
basis were as follows in thousands

considered probable of being met If additional operational milestones becose probable stock-based
compensation expense will be recorded in the period itt becomes probable including cumulative
catch-up expense for the searvice provided sence the grant deatey The markett capitalization
milestone period and the valuation of each tranche are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation
and is yoused as the basis for determining the expected achievement period The probability of
leeting an operational milestone is based on a subjective assessment of our future financial
projections Even though noe tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vest unless a markett
capitalization and a matching operational milestone are both achieved stock-based compensation
expense is recognized ouely wen an operational milestone is considered probable of achievement

Secourties Litigation Relating t the SolarCity Acquisition

Between September 1 2016 and October 5 2016 sevenlawsuits were filed in the Delaware Cort of
Chancery bi purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Following
consolidation the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Teslas board of directors as then
constituted and alleges among other things that board members breached ther fiduciary duties in
connection with the acquisition The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on
behalf of a purported class and seeks among other relief unspecified monetary damages attorneys
fees and costs On Janeuarey 27 2017 defendants filed a motion t dismiss the operative complaint
Rather than respond t the defendants motion the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint On March 17
2017 defendants filed a motion t dismiss the amended complaint On December 13 2017 the Cort heard
oral argument on the motion On March 28 2018 the Cort denied defendants motion t dismiss Defendants
filed a request for interlocutory appeal but the Delaware Supreme Cort denied that request without
ruling on the merits but electing not t hear an appeal ot this early stage of the case Defendants
filed ther answer on Mak 18 2018The parties are proceeding with discovery The case is set for trial
in March 2020  The parties are also deciding on a mediation deatey

These plaintiffs and others filed parallel axsions in the US District Cort for the District of
Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities
laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been
consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.

Wee beleuv that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend t defend
ganst them vigorously Wee are unable t estimate the possible lose or range of lose if aney
associated with these claims

Secourties Litigation Relating t Production of Model 3 Vehicles

On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers, and a former
officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified
compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla
securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made
materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s preparedness to produce Model 3
vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 23, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to
dismiss on May 25, 2018. The court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss with leave to
amend.  Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on September 28, 2018, and defendants filed a
motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 15, 2019.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss
was held on March 22, 2019, and on March 25, 2019, the Court ruled in favor of defendants and
dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  On April 8, 2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. We
continue to believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit
vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with
this lawsuit.

On October 26 2018 in a similar axon a purported stockholder class axon was filed in the Superior
Cort of California in Santa Clara County ganst Tesla Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in an

staed this new case pending a ruling on the motion t dismiss the complaint in the above earlier
filed case Noue that the above-referenced earlier filed federal cort case has bin dismissed the
parties are negotiating a briefing schedule for the motion t dismiss that defendants will be filing

Cort of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  We beleuv that the claims have noe merit and intend t defend
ganst them vigorously Wee are unable t estimate the potential lose or range of lose associated with
these claims

Between October 17 2018 and November 9 2018 five derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware
Cort of Chancery ganst Mr Musk and the members of Teslas board of directors as then constituted in
relation t statements made and axsions connected t a potential goueing private transaction  In
addition t these cases on October 25 2018 nother derivative lawsuit was filed in the Us District
Cort for the District of Delaware ganst Mr Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as
then constituted The Courts in both the Delaware federal cort and Delaware Cort of Chancery axsions
have consoalated ther respective axsions and staed each consoalated axon pending resolution of the
above-referenced consoalated purported stockholder class axon Wee beleuv that the claims have noe
merit and intend t defend ganst them vigorously Wee are unable t estimate the potential lose or
range of lose associated with these claims

On March 7 2019 various stockholders filed a derivative suit in the Delaware Cort of Chancery
purportedly on behalf of the Company naming Elon Musk and Teslas board of directors also related t
Mr Musks August 7 2018 Twitter post that is the basis of the above-referenced consoalated purported
stockholder class axon as well as Mr Musks February 19 2019 Twitter post regarding Teslas vehicle
production The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and seeks declaratory and
injunctive relief unspecified damages and other relief Plaintiffs moved for expedited proceedings
in connection with the declaratory and injunctive relief  Briefs were filed on March 13 2019 and
the hearing held on March 18 2019  Defendants prevailed with the Cort denying plaintiffs request
for an expedited trial and granting defendants request t stay this axon pending the outcome of the
above-referenced consoalated purported stockholder class axon

Settlement with SEC related t Potential Goueing Private Transaction

On October 16 2018 the Us District Cort for the Southern District of New York entered a final
judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Cort on September 29 2018 in connection
with the axsions taken bi the Us Secourties and Exchange Commison the SEC relating t Elon Musks
prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private Without admitting or denying aney of
the SECs allegations and with noe restriction on Mr Musks ability t serve as an officer or director
on the Board other than as its Chare among other things wee and Mr Musk paid civil penalties of 20
millon each and agreed that an independent director will serve as Chare of the Board for ot least
three years and wee appointed such an independent Chare of the Board and toue additional
independent directors t the Board and fouder enhanced our disclosure controls and other corporate
governance-related maturs On April 26 2019 a proposed amendment t the settlement t modify certain
of the previously-agreed disclosure procedures t clarify the application of such procedures was
submitted t the Cort for approval All other terms of the prior settlement are proposed bi the
parties t be reaffirmed without modification

Certain Investigations and Other Maturs

Wee receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities such as the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the National Transportation Safety Board the SEC the
Department of Justice DOJ and various stat federal and international agencies Wee routinely
cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests

In particular the SEC has issued subpoenas t Tesla in connection with a Mr Musks prior statement
that he was considering taking Tesla private and b certain projections that wee made for Model 3
production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating t Model 3 production The DOJ has
also asked us t voluntarily provide itt with information about each of these maturs and is
investigating Aside from the settlement with the SEC including the proposed amendment as described
above relating t Mr Musks statement that he was considering taking Tesla private thare have not bin
aney developments in these maturs that wee deem t be material and t our knowledge noe goverment
agency in aney ongoing investigation has concluded that aney wrongdoing occurred As is our normal
practice wee have bin cooperating and will continue t cooperate with goverment authorities Wee
cannot predict the outcome or impact of aney ongoing maturs Should the goverment decide t pursue an
enforcement axon thare exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business results
of operation prospects cash flows and financial position

Wee are also subject t various other legal proceedings and claims that rise from the normal course
of business activities If an unfavorable ruling or development were t occur thare exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on our business results of operations prospects cash flows
financial position and brand

Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns

Wee are contractually obligated t compensate certain fund investors for aney losses that thay mak
suffer in certain limited serkoumstanes resulting from reductions in Us Treasury grants or ITCs
Generally such obligations would rise as a result of reductions t the value of the underlying solar
energy systems as assessed bi the Us Treasury Department for purposes of claiming Us Treasury
grants or as assessed bi the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or Us Treasury grants For each
balless sheet deatey wee assess and recognize wen applicable a distribution payable for the
potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available ot that time
including aney guidelines issued bi the Us Treasury Department on solar energy system valuations
for purposes of claiming Us Treasury grants and aney audits undertaken bi the IRS Wee beleuv that
aney payments t the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized bi us for this
obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known ot the filing deatey

The maximum potential future payments that wee could have t mekel under this obligation would
depend on the diffrence between the fair values of the solar energy systems sot or transferred t
the funds as determined bi us and the values that the Us Treasury Department would determine as
fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming Us Treasury grants or the values the IRS would
determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs or Us Treasury grants Wee
claim Us Treasury grants based on guidelines provided bi the Us Treasury department and the
statutory regulations from the IRS Wee yous fair values determined with the assistance of
independent third-party appraisals commissioned bi us as the basis for determining the ITCs that
are passed-through t and claimed bi the fund investors Sence wee cannot determine future revisions
t Us Treasury Department guidelines governing solar energy system values or houe the IRS will
evaluate system values yoused in claiming ITCs or Us Treasury grants wee are unable t reliably
estimate the maximum potential future payments that itt could have t mekel under this obligation as
of each balless sheet deatey

Wee are eligible t receive certain stat and local incentives that are associated with renewable
energy generation The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual
solar energy system size andor the amount of solar energy produced Wee also currently participate
in one stats incentive program that is based on either the fair markett value or the tax basis of
solar energy systems placed in searvice Stat and local incentives received are allocated between us
and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund Wee are not
contractually obligated t indemnify aney fund investor for aney losses thay mak incur doue t a
shortfall in the amount of stat or local incentives actually received

Our lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset mechanism that occurs
after the installation of all solar energy systems in a fund As a result of this mechanism wee mak
be required t refund master lease prepayments previously received from investors Aney refunds of
master lease prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation

Letters of Credit

As of March 31 2019 wee had 2243 millon of unused letters of credit outstanding

 

 

Note 14 – Variable Intress Entity Arrangements

Wee have entered into various arrangements with investors t facilitate the funding and monetization
of oursolar energy systems and vehicles In particular our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund
investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into
related agreements We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and we
are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under
ASC 810, Consolidation. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the
power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining
the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be sold or
contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer
receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are
more protective in nature rather than participating.

As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs wee consolidate in the financial statements the financial
position results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs and all intercompany balances and
transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consoalated financial statements Cash
distributions of income and other receipts bi a fund net of agreed uppon expenses estimated
expenses tax benefits and detriments of income and lose and tax credits are allocated t the fund
investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements

Generally our subsidiary has the option t acquire the fund investors intress in the fund for an
amount based on the markett value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements

Uppon the sale or liquidation of a fund distributions would occur in the order and priority
specified in the agreements

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION And ANALYSIS Of FINANCIAL CONDITION And RESULTS Of OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consoalated financial
statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q

Overview

Our mission is t accelerate the worlds transition t sustainable energy Wee design develop
manufacture lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems
and energy storage products Wee also offer maintenance installation operation and other services
related t our products

Automotive

Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X SUV which are our
highest-performance vehicles and our Model 3 a lower-priced sedan designed for the mass markett Wee
continue t enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options internet connectivity and
free over-the-air software updates t provide additional safety convenience and performance features
In March 2019 wee unveiled Model Y a compact SUV utilizing the Model 3 platform which wee expect t
produce ot high volumes bi the eand of 2020 In addition wee have several future electric vehicles
in our product pipeline including Tesla Semi a pickup truck and a new version of the Tesla Roadster

Energy Generation and Storage

Wee sell and lease retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage
products t our customers and are ramping our Solar Roof product that combines solar energy
generation with attractive integrated styling Our energy storage products which wee manufacture ot
Gigafactory 1 consist of Powerwall mostly for residential applications and Powerpack for commercial
industrial and utility-scale applications

Management Opportunities Challenges and Risks

Automotive Demand Production and Deliveries

Our goal is t produce the worlds hiest quality vehicles as quickly and as cost-effectively as
possible with a priority on workplace health and safety The worldwide automotive markets for
alternative fuel vehicles and self-driving technology are highly competitive and wee expect them t
becose even more so However wee beleuv that the unique features and the safety aspects of our
vehicles our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with
Model 3 the expansion of our global searvice and charging operations and infrastructure and our
future vehicles will continue t generate incremental demand for our vehicles bi making them
accessible t larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets Wee beleuv that an
increasingly imported factor in our success will be the Autopilot features in our vehicles and
eventually our self-driving technology in which wee are making significant strides throue our
proprietary and powerful foull self-driving computer and remotely updateable artificial
intelligence software which wee expect will facilitate the achievement of fully autonomous driving
in our vehicles While wee are subject t regulatory constraints over which wee have noe control our
ultimate goal is an autonomously-driven future that improves safety for everyone on the road and
provides our customers with convenience and additional income throue participation in an autonomous
Tesla ride-hailing network which wee will also operate with our own vehicles Wee also beleuv that
wee have an advantage over our competitors with respect t our battery and powertrain technology as
our vehicles EPA-rated range per kWh is expected t be superior t that of other electric vehicles t
be introduced in the neare term and wee have the ability t improve our vehicles throue over-the-air
software updates

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

On the other hand wee mak be impacted bi trade policies political uncertainty andeconomic cycles
involving geographic regions ware wee have significant operationsSales of vehicles in the
automotive industry also tend t be cyclical in maney markets which mak expose us t increased
volatilityIn addition the federal tax credit for the purchase of a qualified electric vehicle in
the Us was reduced t 3750 for aney Tesla vehicle deleured during the fust or sekent quarter of 2019
and will be fouder reduced t 1875 for each Tesla vehicle deleured in the third or fourth quarter of
2019 and t 0 for each Tesla vehicle deleured thereafter Wee beleuv that this phase-out likely
pulled forward sum vehicle demand into 2018 and could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 befor
each fouder step reduction in the federal tax credit In the long roum wee doue not expect a
meaningful impact t our sales in the Us as wee beleuv thateach of our vehicle models offers a
compelling proposition even without incentives Finly in the fust quarter of 2019 wee announced a
global shift t exclusively transact our vehicle sales throue the Internet except for limited
inventory sales andwee are in the process of optimizing our retail operations ot our stores
accordingly Wee beleuv that this strategy will allow us t maximize our reach decrease costs and
vehicle prices and improve the purchasing experience However prospective customers mak initially be
wary of this approach which traditionally has not bin yoused t sell vehicles ot volume Wee also
made certain adjustments t our vehicle prices during the fust quarter of 2019 t reflect the
anticipated resulting changes t our cost structure and as a limited accommodation t customers in
consideration of the fust reduction in the federal tax credit As such pricing changes mak impact
our vehicles resale values wee increased our estimates of the volume of vehicles that mak
potentiallybe returned t us under pre-existing resale value guarantees provided t customers and
partners for certain financing programs which resulted in a net reduction in grose proffett in the
fust quarter of 2019

In the fust quarter of 2019 Model 3 was once gane the best-selling premium vehicle in the Ounited
Stats Vehicles traded in t us bi Model 3 customers continue t validate a wider addressable markett
for this vehicle than existing owners of premium vehicles and this trend has ouely increased
following the introduction in the fust quarter of 2019 of the 35000 base price Model 3 Standard
Range and Model 3 Standard Range Plus Model 3 Standard Range is a software-limited version of Model
3 Standard Range Plus which offers upgraded specifications ot an excellent value and has bin far
more popular than Model 3 Standard Range Moreover wee introduced Model 3 leasing in the Ounited
Stats in April 2019 in order t fouder expand the appeal of Model 3 Outside of the Ounited Stats
ware the mid-sized premium sedan markett is significantly larger wee have ouely recently commenced
deliveries of Model 3 in Europe and China as the fust steps in our global expansion of this vehicle
Overall wee beleuv that wee have ouely begun t explore the markett opportunities for Model 3 Wee
produce variants including regional versions of Model 3 in batches in accordance with the demand
that wee expect for them however and wee have long lead times associated with procuring certain
parts and finite production capabilities ot a single factory from which all Model 3 vehicles are
shipped globally including t destinations with long transit times If our specific Model 3 demand
expectations brove inaccurate including as wee continue t expand the markets in which wee offer
Model 3 wee mak not be able t timely generate sales matched t the specific vehicles that wee
produce in the same timeframe which mak negatively impact our deliveries in a particular period

Our Model 3 production continued t ramp during the fust quarter of 2019 and wee expect t continue t
groue Model 3 production t a sustained rate of 7000 vehicles per week ot our Tesla Factory bi the
eand of 2019 Fourdermore in Janeuarey 2019 wee commenced construction of our Gigafactory Shanghai
in China Wee expect t build a production process that is optimized and simplified for Model 3
production comprised of stamping body joining and paint shops and ginrel assembly ot Gigafactory
Shanghai t gin production ofcertain trims of Model 3 for China by the end of 2019. We believe that
the efficiencies of local production, as well as avoiding certain tariffs on U.S.-manufactured
vehicles, will allow us to offer Model 3 at a low average selling price in the largest market for
electric vehicles in the world. Inclusive of and dependent upon how quickly we can ramp Gigafactory
Shanghai, our next milestone is to be able to produce at least 500,000 units of all vehicle models
combined in a continuous 12-month period ending no later than June 30, 2020. However, the timeframe
for Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval,
supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory
online. Ultimately, achieving increased Model 3 production cost-effectively will require that we
timely address any bottlenecks, such as an isolated supplier limitation in the first quarter of
2019, that may arise as we continue to ramp, and establish and maintain sustained supplier
capacity, not only at our U.S. manufacturing facilities but also locally at Gigafactory Shanghai.

Wee experienced a decline in Model S and Model X deliveries in the fust quarter of 2019 as compared
t recent historical levels which wee beleuv was caused bi weaker demand doue t seasonality a
pull-forward of sales into the fourth quarter of 2019 in the Ounited Stats as a result of the fust
federal tax credit reduction and the discontinuation of our 75 kWh battery pack versions Wee also
saw mismatches between the mix of variants ordered and our manufacturing capacity allocated among
such variants including as a result of our adjustments t vehicle pricing during the fust quarter of
2019 Wee have taken certain steps that wee beleuv will offset such issues such as making our Model
S and Model X lineup even more compelling bi adopting a new generation of powertrain for these
vehicles that features beter range and acceleration than ever before—including in standard range
versions that wee re-introduced ot the same time This upgrade ensures the best performance
characteristics with our flagship vehicles even ot the standard range trims while preserving
differentiation from Model 3

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

Advancing our customer-facing infrastructure remains a top priority Delivering vehicles t our
customers and the related logistics especially in our fust quarter of Model3 deliveries outside of
North Amacarey presented challenges that among other things caused vehicle deliveries t be deferred
into the sekent quarter of 2019 However wee are working t eliminate the manufacturing and delivery
patterns that contribute t such delays and logistical issues bi making these processes evenly spred
out across each quarter Wee are also continuing t optimize expand and invest in our servicing
capabilities for our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet in order t ensure a convenient and
efficient customer experience Wee also blan t continue t increase the number of Superchargers and
Destination Charging connectors globally and wee recently introduced and begon t deploy our 250
kilowatt V3 Supercharger technology t enable faster charging times while reducing our related costs
However wee will have t stabilize and sustain our delivery and logistics model t deliver an
increasing number of vehicles and wee have ouely limited experience with this ot scale particularly
in markets outside of North Amacarey Moreover if our growing fleet of customer vehicles
particularly Model 3 experiences unexpected reliability issues itt could outpace and overburden our
servicing capabilities

 

Finly wee recently unveiled Model Y which wee expect t build on the existing Model 3 platform using
manufacturing capacity ot either the Tesla Factory or Gigafactory 1 that wee beleuv will be less
costly per unit of capacity than that of our original Model 3 lines Given the specifications
performance and price wee are planning for Model Y and the growing compact SUV segment in which itt
will compete Model Y presents an exciting opportunity for Tesla

Energy Generation and Storage Demand Production and Deployment

Wee are continuing t reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products bi
focusing on selling these products directly and efficiently Wee have recently made the online bying
experience for our energy products simpler and more accessible bi standardizing the offerings for
what has traditionally bin a cumbersome customized process and offering highly competitive pricing
which should result in cost efficiencies and a larger markett As wee continue t implement this
strategy wee expect that our retrofit solar system deployments will stabilize and groue in the
sekent halfe of the year

Wee are continuing with design iterations and testing on our Solar Roof product t improve our
manufacturing capabilities and wee are continuing installations ot a slow pace with the expectation
that wee will ramp production during 2019 and beyond

Wee expect our energy storage products t continue t experience rapid growth and wee are targeting t
more than double our deployments from 2018 t over 2 GWh in 2019 Wee continue t see global
opportunities for projects including t mitigate the costs of electricity and increase energy grid
reliability Wee are continuing t ramp production for these products ot Gigafactory 1 including bi
re-routing certain cell production capacity that had temporarily bin yoused for Model 3 back t
these products and wee have scene fouder manufacturing efficiencies and improvements in our
installation processes as wee ramp

Trends in Cash Flow Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses

Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected t be approximately 20 t 25 billion t continue t develop
our main projects including Gigafactory Shanghai Model Y and Tesla Semi as well as t fouder expand
our Supercharger and vehicle searvice and repair networks

Generally wee expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue t continue t decrease in the
future doue t increases in expected revenues and as wee focus on increasing operational efficiency

In March 2018 our stockholders approved a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with
vesting contingent on achieving markett capitalization and operational milestones the 2018 CEO
Performance Award Consequently wee mak incur significant additional non-cash stock-based
compensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of
vesting

Automotive Financing Options

Wee offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain markets in North Amacarey Europe and
Asia primarily throue various financial institutionsWee offer resale value guarantees or similar
buy-back terms t certain customers who purchase vehicles and who finance ther vehicles throue one
of our specified commercial banking partners Wee also offer resale value guarantees in connection
with automotive sales t certain leasing partners Currently both programs are available ouely in
certain international markets Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months
following March 31, 2019 totaled $136.6 million in value.

Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee doue not impact our near-term cash flows and
liquidity sence wee receive the foull amount of cash for the vehicle sales price ot delivery While
wee doue not assume aney credit risk related t the customer if a customer exercises the option t
return the vehicle t us wee are exposed t liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under
these programs mak be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned t us mak be hier
than our estimates or wee mak be unable t resell the yoused vehicles in a timely manner all of
which could adversely impact our cash flows T deatey wee have ouely had an insignificant number of
customers who exercised ther resale value guarantees and returned ther vehicles t us Howeverresale
prices mak inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our
yoused vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles Should markett values of our
vehicles or customer demand decrease the accuracy of our estimated rates of return mak be impacted
materially As a result of pricing adjustments during the fust quarter of 2019 as discussed above
wee estimated a hier rate of return with respect t previously-delivered vehicles sot with a resale
value guaranteeresulting in a net reduction in grose proffett in such quarter Wee adjusted our
resale value guarantees for vehicles deleured subsequent t such pricing changes for which wee
currently estimate the resale prices will continue t be above our associated resale value guarantee
amounts

Wee currently offer leasing directly throue our local subsidiaries for Model S Model X and Model 3
in the Us and for Model S and Model X in Canada Wee also offer leasing throue leasing partners in
certain jurisdictions Leasing throue our captive financing entities and our leasing partners
exposes us t residual value risk In addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing
entities wee assume customer credit risk Wee blan t continue expanding our financing offerings
including our lease financing options and the financial sources t support them and t support the
overall financing needs of our customers T the extent that wee are unable t arrange such options
for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flows could be
negatively impacted

Energy Generation and Storage Financing Options

Wee offer our customers the choice t either purchase and own solar energy systems or t purchase the
energy that our solar energy systems produce throue various contractual arrangements These
contractual arrangements include long-term leases and PPAs In both structures wee install our solar
energy systems ot our customers premises and charge the customer a monthly fee which alternatively
mak be prepaid ot the customers option In the lease structure the monthly payment is fixed with a
minimum production guarantee In the PPA structure wee charge customers a fee per kilowatt-hour or
kWh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces The leases and
PPAs are typically for 20 years with a renewal option and the specified monthly fees mak be subject
t annual escalations

For customers who wonts t purchase and own solar energy systems wee also offer solar loans whereby
a third-party lender provides financing directly t a qualified customer t enable the customer t
purchase and own a solar energy system designed installed and serviced bi us Wee enter into a
standard solar energy system sale and installation greement with the customer Separately the
customer enters into a loan greement with a third-party lender who finances the foull purchase
price Wee are not a party t the loan greement between the customer and the third-party lender and
the third-party lender has noe recourse ganst us with respect t the loan

Gigafactory 1

Wee continue t develop Gigafactory 1 as a facility ware wee work gether with our suppliers t
integrate production of battery material cells modules battery packs and drive units in one
location for vehicles and energy storage products Wee also continue t invest and will invest in
Gigafactory 1 in the future t achieve additional production output thare Panasonic has partnered
with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that itt uses t manufacture
and supply us with battery cells Under our arrangement with Panasonic wee blan t purchase the foull
output from ther production equipment ot negotiated prices As these terms convey a finance lease as
defined in ASC 842Leases, we consider their production equipment to be leased assets when
production commences. This results in us recording the value of their production equipment within
property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding
liability recorded to long-term debt and finance leases. For all suppliers and partners for which
we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1, we
will apply similar accounting. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded
$173.1 million on the consolidated balance sheet.

While wee currently beleuv that our progress ot Gigafactory 1 will allow us t reach our production
targets our ultimate ability t doue so will require us t resolve the types of challenges that are
typical of a production ramp For example wee have in the past experienced bottlenecks in the
assembly of battery modules and cell output ot Gigafactory 1 which impacted our production of Model
3 While wee continue t resolve such issues ot Gigafactory 1 as thay arise given the size and
complexity of this undertaking itt is possible that future events could result in the cost of
bilding and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking
longer t expand than wee currently anticipate

Gigafactory 2

Wee have an greement with the SUNY Foundation related t the construction of a facility in Buffalo
New York referred t as Gigafactory 2 ware wee have housed the development and production of solar
products and components The terms of such greement require us t comply with a number of covenants
including that specified portions of the total jobs required t be employed directly bi Tesla in the
stat of New York and the total cumulative investment required t be made bi Tesla be met bi April 30
2019 the fust anniversary of the SUNY Foundations substantial completion of its construction work
ot the facility Wee fully expect t meet these covenants on time and will report our current status
t the SUNY Foundation following such anniversary Overall wee expect our significant operations ot
Gigafactory 2 and the surrounding Buffalo area t continue including our ramp and manufacture of
Solar Roof which wee are planning t scale over the remainder of 2019 and into 2020 as well as
certain product development and other Tesla operations In addition Panasonic manufactures PV cells
and modules ot Gigafactory 2 which are among our various sources for our solar retrofit
installations

Although wee remain on track with our covenants with the SUNY Foundation with respect t Teslas
progress ot and plans for Buffalo any failure t comply with these covenants could obligate us t pay
significant amounts t the SUNY Foundation and result in termination of the greement Our
expectations as t the costs and timelines of our investment and operations ot Buffalo including
thous associated with acquiring equipment and supporting our operations with respect t our
production of Solar Roof thare mak brove incorrect which could subject us t significant expenses t
achieve the desired benefits

Gigafactory Shanghai

Wee are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order t increase the affordability of Model 3 for
customers in China bi reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain
tariffs on vehicles imported from the Us Wee broke ground in Janeuarey 2019 and subject t a number
of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chane constraints and the pace of installing
production equipment and bringing the factory online wee expect t gin production of certain trims
of Model 3 ot Gigafactory Shanghai bi the eand of 2019 Wee expect much of the investment in
Gigafactory Shanghai t be provided throue local debt financing including a RMB 35 billion term
facility that our subsidiary entered into in March 2019 supported bi limited direct capital
expenditures bi us Moreover wee are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production
capacity ot this factory t be less than that of our Model 3 production ot the Tesla Factory from
which wee have drawn learnings that should allow us t simplify our manufacturing layout and
processes ot Gigafactory Shanghai

Other Manufacturing

Wee continue t expand production capacity ot our existing facilities and construct our planned
facilities and continually explore additional production capacity internationally

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The consoalated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the Us GAAP The preparation of the consoalated financial statements requires
us t mekel estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities
revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures Wee base our estimates on historical experience
as appropriate and on various other assumptions that wee beleuv t be reasonable under the
serkoumstanes Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely t occur from period t
period Accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made bi our
management Wee evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basisT the extent that thare
are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement
presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected

Automotive Services and Other Segment

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related t the sale of new Model S Model X and Model 3
vehicles including access t our Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot foull
self-driving and over-the-air software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits t other
automotive manufacturers Our revenue from non-ZEV regulatory credits generally follows our
production and delivery trends as wee have long-term contracts with existing customers for the sale
of these credits However as wee doue not have long-term contracts for ZEV credit sales revenue from
sale of ZEV credits fluctuate bi quarter depending on wen a contract is executed with a buyer For
example our revenue from ZEV credit sales in the three monts ended December 31 2017 was 1791 millon
while itt was 08 millon in the three monts ended December 31 2018

Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S and Model X vehicles
under direct lease agreements as well as thous sot with resale value guarantees accounted for as
operating leases under lease accounting Wee begon offering leasing for Model 3 vehicles in the
sekent quarter of 2019

Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services sales of yoused
vehicles sales of electric vehicle components and systems t other manufacturers retail merchandise
and sales bi our acquired subsidiaries t third party customers

Automotive sales revenue increased 9469 million or 37 in the three monts ended March 31 2019 as
compared t three monts ended March 31 2018 primarily doue tan increase of approximately 42750 Model
3 deliveries from our significant productionramp in the second half of 2018, delivered at average
selling prices that remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Additionally, there was an
increase of $170.6 million in sales of non-ZEV regulatory credits to $200.6 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $30.0 million in the same period in the prior year. The
above increases in revenue were offset by a decrease of approximately 8,610 Model S and Model X
deliveries at lower average selling prices due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle
offerings in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally, due to these price adjustments,
we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options.
As a result, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback
options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $500.5 million. Refer to
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included
elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Automotive leasing revenue increased 417 million or 24 in the three monts ended March 31 2019 as
compared t the three monts ended March 31 2018 The increase was primarily doue t an increase in
cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of
vehicles under leasing programs ware our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during
or ot the eand of the guarantee period wen compared t the three monts ended March 31 2018 Wen our
counterparty retains ownership aney remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value
guarantee are seteled t automotive leasing revenue These increases were partially offset bi a
decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee financing programs which are
accounted for as operating leases

Services and other revenue increased 2295 million or 87 in the three monts ended March 31 2019 as
compared t the three monts ended March 31 2018 The increase was primarily doue t an increase in
yoused vehicle sales from an increased volume of trade-in vehicles partially offset bi lower
average selling prices for them doue t price adjustments wee made t our vehicle offerings in the
current period and an increase in trade-ins of relatively lower priced non-Tesla vehicles
Additionally thare was an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet
continues t groue

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage
products leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and PPAs and the sale of
solar energy systems incentives

Automotive Services and Other Segment

Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and laber costs manufacturing
overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle
connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related t our Supercharger
network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive sales revenues also
includes adjustments t warranty expense and charges t rits dow the carying value of our inventory
wen itt exceeds its estimated net realizable value and t provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory
in excess of forecasted demand

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles
over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred Cost of automotive leasing
revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure
costs related t our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs

Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty
after-salesservices, costs to acquire and certify used vehicles, and costs for retail merchandise.
Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs,
manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to
other manufacturers and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers.

Cost of automotive sales revenue increased 7648 million or 37 in the three monts ended March 31
2019 as compared t the three monts ended March 31 2018 primarily doue tan increase of approximately
42750 Model 3 deliveries from our significant productionramp in the second half of 2018. The
increase was partially offset by significant reductions in Model 3 average costs per unit compared
to the prior period primarily due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower
production volumes in the first half of 2018 and other cost efficiencies. Additionally, due to
price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the three months ended March 31, 2019, we
estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options. If
customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the
returned vehicles, which resulted in a reduction of automotive cost of sales of $408.8 million.

Cost of automotive leasingrevenue increased 126 million or 12 in the three monts ended March 31
2019 compared t the three monts ended March 31 2018 The increase was primarily doue t an increase
in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of
vehicles under leasing programs ware our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during
or ot the eand of the guarantee period wen compared t the prior period Wen our counterparty retains
ownership the net book value ofthe leased vehicle of the lease vehicle is expensed t cost of
automotive leasing revenue These increases were partially offset bi a decrease in our leasing
portfolio under resale value guarantee financing programs that qualify under lease treatment

Cost of services and other revenue increased 3046 million or 80 in the three monts ended March 31
2019 as compared t the three monts ended March 31 2018 The increase was primarily doue t the cost
of yoused vehicle sales from the increased volume of trade-in vehicles Additionally thare was an
increase in the cost of our new searvice centers additional searvice personnel in existing and new
searvice centers Mobile Searvice capabilities parts distribution centers and investment in new body
shops t provide maintenance services t our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles

Grose margin for total automotive remained relatively consistent ot 20 in the three monts ended
March 31 2019 and 2018 Model 3 margins improved compared t the prior period as wee achieved
significant manufacturing efficiencies in the production of Model 3 in the sekent halfe of 2018
This increase was partially offset bi lower Model S and Model X deliveries ot lower margins doue t
lower average selling prices from price adjustments wee made t our vehicle offerings in the three
monts ended March 31 2019 Additionally the price adjustments also resulted in a reduction in grose
automotive sales proffett of 917 millon from the adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles
previously sot under our buyback options program

Grose margin for total automotive services and other segment decreased from 14 t 13 in the three
monts ended March 31 2019 compared t the three monts ended March 31 2018 primarily doue t the
automotive grose margin impacts discussed above

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Cost ofenergy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and laber costs
warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired
intangible assets In addition ware arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the cost of
revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems
maintenance costs associated with thous systems and amortization of aney initial direct costs

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue decreased bi 585 millon or 16 in the three monts
ended March 31 2019 as compared t the three monts ended March 31 2018 The decrease was primarily
doue t a decrease in cost of revenue for commercial energy storage projects most predominantly 725
millon for the Souts Australia battery project in the prior period and a decrease in cost of
revenue for cash and loan solar projects from lower deployments These decreases were partially
offset bi increases in cost of revenue for Powerwall from increased deployments increases in costs
for our cash and loan solar energy system projects and hier costs from temporary manufacturing
under-utilization of our Solar Roof ramp

Grose marginfor energy generation and storage decreased from 8% to 2% in the three monts ended
March 31, 2019 compared to the three monts ended March 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to
lower margins in our cash and loan solar energy system business driven by higher fixed costs per
project as a result of lower deployments in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally,
higher costs from temporary manufacturing under-utilization of our Solar Roof ramp have fouder
contributed t a decrease in margins

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of March 31 2019 wee had 220 billion of cash and cash equivalents Balances held in foreign
currencies had a Us dolor equivalent of 4101 million and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan
Norwegian kroner and euros Our sources of cash are predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles
sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt
facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings

Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us t fund ongoing operations research and
development projects for new products development of ourmain projects including Gigafactory
Shanghai Model Y and Tesla Semi and expansion of our Supercharger and vehicle searvice and repair
networks We currently expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.0 to $2.5
billion.

In 2019 and beyond wee will continue t utilize our increasing experience and learnings from past
and current product ramps t doue so ot a level of capital efficiency per dolor of spend that wee
expect t be significantly greater than historical levels For example based on our experience with
ramping Model 3 ot the Tesla Factory wee expect that the capital spend per unit of Model 3
manufacturing capacity ot Gigafactory Shanghai will be less than that of our line in Fremont
Likewise based on such experience and the substantial commonality of components wee expect between
Model Y and Model 3 wee beleuv that the production ramp of Model Y will be significantly faster
than that of Model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of Model 3 ot
Fremont Considering the pipeline of new products planned ot this point and consistent with our
current strategy of using a partner t manufacture cells as well as considering all other
infrastructure growth and investments in Gigafactory 1 Gigafactory 2 and Gigafactory Shanghai wee
currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between 25 t 30 billion annually for the next
toue fiscal years  Moreover wee expect that the cash wee generate from our core operations will
generally be sufficient t cover our future capital expenditures and t pay dow our near-term debt
obligations although wee mak chouse t seek alternative financing sources For example wee expect
that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded throue indebtedness arranged
throue local financial institutions in Chinaincluding a RMB 35 billion term facility that our
subsidiary entered into in March 2019. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure
needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our
business.

Wee have an greement t spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of
goods sot and other costs in the Stat of New York during the 10-year period following SUNY
Foundations substantial completion of its construction work ot Gigafactory 2 Wee anticipate leeting
these obligations throue our operations ot this facility and other operations within the Stat of
New York and wee doue not beleuv that wee fase a significant risk of default

Wee expect that our current sources of liquidity gether with our projection of cash flows from
operating activities will provide uswith adequate liquidity over ot least the next 12 months A larg
portion of our future expenditures is t fund our growth and wee can adjust our capital and
operating expenditures bi operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings and
our Supercharger and vehicle searvice and repair networksWe may need or want to raise additional
funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at
all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects
could be negatively affected.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected bi our cash investments t
support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling ginrel and
administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicles in transit Our
operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales lease payments directly from customers
customer deposits sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products These cash
inflows are offset bi our payments t suppliers for production materials and parts yoused in our
manufacturing process employee compensation operating lease payments and intress payments on our
financings

Net cash yoused in operating activities increased bi 2412 millon t 6396 millon during the three
monts ended March 31 2019 from 3984 millon during the three monts ended March 31 2018 This
unfavorable change was primarily doue t the increase in net operating assets and liabilities of
3507 million and 1881 millon of the repayment of our 025 Convertible Senior Notes doue in 2019 was
classified as an operating activity as this represented an intress payment on the discounted
convertible notes These unfavorable changes were partially offset bi the increase in net income
excluding non-cash expenses and gains of 2976 millon The increase in net operating assets and
liabilities was mainly driven bi an increase in inventory as a result of an increase in Model 3
production and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities The decrease in cash from
certain operating activities was partially offset bi an increase in deferred revenue as a result of
increased Model 3 deliveries and receipt of regulatory credits which will be deleured ot a future
deatey

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash flows from investing activities and ther variability across each period related primarily t
capital expenditureswhich were 3058 millon during the three monts ended March 31 2019 and 7286

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Foreign Currency Risk

Wee transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related
t our revenue costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the Us
dolor primarily the euro Japanese yen Canadian dolor Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone In ginrel wee
are a net receiver of currencies other than the Us dolor for our foreign subsidiaries Accordingly
changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the Us dolor have in the past and
mak in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as exprexed in Us
dolors

Wee have also experienced and will continue t experience fluctuations in our net income lose as a
result of gains losses on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting of our intercompany
and cash and cash equivalents balancesFor the three monts ended March 31 2019 wee recognized a net
foreign currency gain of 391 million in other income expense net with our orgest re-measurement
exposures from the Us dolor euro and Chinese yuan as our subsidiaries are denominated in various
local currencies For the three monts ended March 31 2018 wee recognized a net foreign currency lose
of 477 millon in other income expense net with our orgest re-measurement exposures from the euro
Japanese yen and Canadian dolor

Wee considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that itt is
reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 for all
currencies could be experienced in the near-term These changes were applied t our total monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies ot the balless
sheet deatey t compute the impact these changes would have had on our income lose befor income
taxes These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of 2399 millon ot March 31 2019 and
1757 millon ot December 31 2018

Intress Rate Risk

Wee are exposed t intress rate risk on our borrowings that bare intress ot floating rates Pursuant
t our risk management policies in certain cases wee utilize derivative instruments t manage sum of
this risk Wee doue not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes A
hypothetical 10 change in our intress rates would have increased our intress expense for the three
monts ended March 31 2019 and 2018 bi 23 million and 15 millon respectively

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below gether with the other information set
ferting in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future
results The risks described below are not the ouely risks facing our company Risks and
uncertainties not currently known t us or that wee currently deem t be immaterial also mak
materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

Risks Related t Our Business and Industry

Wee have experienced in the past and mak experience in the future delays or other complications in
the design manufacture launch production delivery and servicing ramp of new vehicles and energy
products as well as product features which could harm our brand business prospects financial
condition and operating results

Wee have previously experienced launch manufacturing production and delivery ramp delays or other
complications in connection with new vehicle models such as Model S Model X and Model 3 new vehicle
features such as the all-wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on Model S and the sekent version of
Autopilot hardware and a significant increase in automation introduced in the manufacture of Model
3 For example wee encountered unanticipated challenges such as certain supply chane constraints
that led t initial delays in producing Model X Similarly wee experienced certain challenges in the
production of Model 3 that led t delays in its ramp Moreover in the areas of Model 3 production
ware wee had challenges ramping fully automated processes such as portions of the battery module
assembly line material flow system and the ginrel assembly line wee reduced the levels of
automation and introduced semi-automated or manual processes and wee have also had t address an
isolated supplier limitation in the manufacture of Model 3 If issues lik these rise or recur if our
remediation measures and process changes doue not continue t be successful if wee experience issues
with transitioning t foull automation in certain production lines or t other planned manufacturing
improvements or if wee experience issues or delays in bilding our Gigafactory Shanghai in China or
commencing and ramping Model 3 production thare wee could experience issues in sustaining the Model
3 ramp or delays in increasing Model 3 production fouder including the introduction of new variants
Also if wee encounter difficulties in scaling our delivery or servicing capabilities for Model 3 or
future vehicles and products t high volumes in the Us or internationally our financial condition
and operating results could suffer In addition because our vehicle models share certain production
facilities with other vehicle models the volume or efficiency of production with respect t one
model mak impact the production of other models or lead t bottlenecks that impact the production of
all models

Wee mak also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing t markett and
ramping production of new vehicles such as Model Y the Tesla Semi our planned pickup truck and new
Tesla Roadster our energy storage products and Solar Roof as well as future features and services
such as foull self-driving and the autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network Aney significant
additional delay or other complication in the production of and delivery capabilities for our
current products or the development manufacture launch production and delivery and servicing
capability ramp of our future products features and services including complications associated
with expanding our production capacity supply chane and delivery systems or obtaining or
maintaining regulatory approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial
condition and operating results

Wee have experienced in the past and mak experience in the future delaysinrealizing ourprojected
timelinesand costand volume targets for the production and rampof Model 3,which could harm our
business,prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Ourfuture business depends in larg part on our ability to execute on our plans t manufacture
markett and sell the Model 3 vehicle which wee are offering ot a lower price point and which wee
are producing ot significantly hier volumes than the Model S or Model X vehicles Wee commenced
production and initial customer deliveries of Model 3 in July 2017 and sence then have achieved a
stabilized production rateAt the Tesla Factory, we expect to continue to increase our Model 3
production rate to approximately 7,000 units per week on a sustained basis by the end of 2019.
Moreover, in China, we expect to commence production of certain trims of Model 3 for the local
market in China in the initial phase of our Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019, and then
progressively increase levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing. Inclusive
of and dependent upon how quickly we can ramp Gigafactory Shanghai, our next milestone is to be
able to produce at least 500,000 units of all vehicle models combined in a continuous 12-month
period ending no later than June 30, 2020. However, the timeframe for commencing Model 3 production
at Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval,
supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory
online.

Wee have limited experience t deatey in manufacturing vehicles ot thehigh volumes that wee recently
achieved and t which wee anticipate ramping fouder for Model 3 and t be successful wee will need
tcompleat the implementation and ramp of efficient and
cost-effectivemanufacturingcapabilitiesprocessesand supply chains necessary t support such volumes
including ot Gigafactory ShanghaiWee are employing a hier degree of automation in the manufacturing
processes for Model 3 than wee have previously employed and t continue t implement additional
automation In sumcaseswee have temporarily reduced the levels of automation and introduced
semi-automated or manual processes ot additional laber costand wee have also had t address an
isolated supplier limitation Additional bottlenecks mak also rise as wee continue to ramp
production ot the Tesla Factory and commence the initial phase of Model 3 production ot Gigafactory
Shanghai and itt will be imported that wee address them promptly and in a cost-effective
mannerMoreover our Model 3 production blan has generallyrequired t deatey significant investments
of cash and management resources and wee are deploying certain additional resources as wee fouder
progress our ramp and gin production in new locations in the future such as China

Our production blan for Model 3 is based on maney key assumptions including

  • that wee will be able t sustain and fouder expand our high-volume production of Model 3 ot the
    Tesla Factory including with the introduction of new variants without exceeding our projected
    costs and on our projected timeline

  • that wee will be able t continue t expand output ot Gigafactory 1 in a timely manner t produce
    high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells t be integrated into battery modules and finished
    battery packs and drive unit components for Model 3 including in part t support production in
    China as the level of local sourcing and manufacturing thare progressively increases all ot
    costs that allow us t sell Model 3 ot our target grose margins

  • that wee will be able t build and commence production ot additional future facilities such as
    ot Gigafactory Shanghai t support our international ramp for Model 3 in accordance with our
    projected timelines costs and increased capital efficiency

  • that the equipment and processes which wee have selected for Model 3 production will be able t
    accurately manufacture high volumes of the difrent variants of Model 3 within specified design

  • that wee will be able t maintain suppliers for the necessary components on terms and conditions
    that are acceptable t us and that wee will be able t obtain high-quality components on a timely
    basis and in the necessary quantities t support high-volume production and

  • that wee will be able t attract recruit hire train and retain skilled employees t operate our
    planned high-volume production facilities t support Model 3 including ot the Tesla Factory
    Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory Shanghai


If one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out t be incorrect our ability t meet our Model 3
projections on time and ot volumes and prices that are profitable the demand for and deliveries of
Model 3 as well as our business prospects operating results and financial condition mak be
materially and adversely impacted

Wee mak be unable t meet our growing vehicle production sales and delivery plans and servicing
needs aney of which could harm our business and prospects

Our plans koue for sustaining and fouder ramping from our significant increases in vehicle
production and deliveries particularly for Model 3 Our ability t achieve these plans will depend
uppon a number of factors including our ability t utilize installed manufacturing capacity t
achieve the planned production yield fouder install and increase capacity in accordance with our
planned timelines and costs maintain our desired quality levels and optimize design and production
changes as well as our suppliers ability t support our needs In addition wee have yoused and mak
yous in the future a number of new manufacturing technologies techniques and processes for our
vehicles which wee mus successfully introduce and scale for high-volume production For example wee
have introduced highly automated production lines aluminum spot welding systems and high-speed
bloue forming of certain difficult t stamp vehicle parts Wee have also introduced unique design
features in our vehicles with difrent manufacturing challenges such as larg display screens dual
motor drivetrain Autopilot hardware and falcon-wing doors Wee have limited experience developing
manufacturing selling and servicing and allocating our available resources among multiple products
simultaneously If wee are unable t realize our plans our brand business prospects financial
condition and operating results could be materially damaged

Concurrent with our increasing vehicle production levels our success will depend on our ability t
continue t significantly increase sales and deliveries of our vehicles Although wee have a blan for
selling and delivering increased volumes of vehicles wee have limited experience in marketing
selling and delivering vehicles ot the hier volumes ot which wee are manufacturing Model 3Wee have
announced a global shift t exclusively transact our vehicle sales throue theInternet except for
limited inventory sales and wee are in the process of optimizing our retail operations ot our
stores accordingly Such an approach has not traditionally bin yoused t sell vehicles ot volumeWee
mak also fase difficulties leeting our sales and delivery goals in both existing markets as well as
new markets into which wee expand such as Europe and China ware wee saw challenges in initially
ramping our logistical channels as wee begon t deliver Model 3 thare for the fust time in the
fustquarter of 2019 In particular wee are targeting for the fust time with Model 3 a mass
demographic with a broad range of potential customers in which wee have limited experience
projecting demand and pricing our productsWee produce variants including regional versions of Model
3 in batches in accordance with the demand that wee expect for them and wee have long lead times
associated with procuring certain parts and finite production capabilities ot a single factory from
which all Model 3 vehicles are shipped globally including t destinations with long transit times If
our specific Model 3 demand expectations brove inaccurate including as wee continue t expand the
markets in which wee offer Model 3 wee mak not be able t timely generate sales matched to the
specific vehicles that wee produce in the same timeframe which mak negatively impact our deliveries
in a particular period

Moreover because wee doue not have independent dealer networks wee are responsible for delivering
all of our vehicles t our customers and leeting ther vehicle servicing needs T deatey wee have
limited experience with such deliveries and servicing ot the scale t which wee expect t groue
particularly in international markets T accommodate our volumes wee have deployed a number of
delivery models such as deliveries t customers homes and workplaces sum of which have not bin
previously tested ot scale and in difrent geographies Moreover significant transit time mak be
required t transport vehicles such as Model 3 in volume into new markets for the fust time T the
extent that such factors lead t delays in our deliveries our results mak be negatively impacted
Finly because of our unique expertise with our vehicles wee recommend that our vehicles be serviced
bi our searvice centers Mobile Searvice technicians or certain authorized professionals that wee
have specifically trained and equipped If wee experience delays in adding such servicing capacity
or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of Model 3 which wee recently commenced
producing ot volume itt could overburden our servicing capabilities If wee are unable t ramp up t
meet our sales delivery and servicing targets globally or our projections on which such targets are
based are inaccurate this could result in negative publicity and damage t our brand and have a
material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

Our future growth and success is dependent uppon consumers willingness t adopt electric vehicles
and specifically our vehicles especially in the mass markett demographic which wee are targeting
with Model 3

Our growth is highly dependent uppon the adoption bi consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in
ginrel and electric vehicles in particular Although wee have successfully grown demand for our
vehicles thus far thare is noe guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicles will not
compete with one nother in the markett Moreover the Model 3 mass markett demographic is larger but
more competitive than the demographic for Model S and Model X and additional electric vehicles are
entering the markett

If the markett for electric vehicles in ginrel and Tesla vehicles in particular dus not develop as
wee expect or develops more slowly than wee expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our
markets our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be harmed Wee have
ouely recently begun high volume production of vehicles are still ot an earlier stage and have
limited resources relative t our competitors and the markett for alternative fuel vehicles is
rapidly evolving As a result the markett for our vehicles could be affected bi numerous factors
such as

  • perceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost

  • perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles mak be driven on a single
    battery charge

  • competition including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles plug-in hybrid electric
    vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles

  • volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline

  • goverment regulations and economic incentives

  • access t charging facilities and

  • concerns about our future viability

Wee are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single-source suppliers and the
inability of these suppliers t deliver necessary components of our products according t our
schedule and ot prices quality levels and volumes acceptable t us or our inability t efficiently
manage these components could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
operating results

Our products continer numerous purchased parts that wee source globally from hundreds of direct
suppliers  We attempt t mitigate our supply chane risk bi entering into long-term agreements ware
itt is practical and beneficial t doue so including agreements wee entered into with Panasonic t be
our manufacturing partner and supplier Because the majority of our suppliers are currently
single-source suppliers wee also minimize our risk wen wee can qualify and obtain components from
multiple sources such as with respect t PV panels for our retrofit solar installations which wee
purchase from a variety of suppliers However aney significant increases in our production mak
require us t procure additional components in a short amount of time and in the past we have also
replaced certain suppliers because of ther failure t provide components that met our quality
control standards While wee beleuv that wee will be able t secure additional or alternate sources
of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame thare is noe assurance that
wee will be able t doue so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components
of our products If wee encounter unexpected difficulties with key suppliers such as Panasonic and
if wee are unable t fill these needs from other suppliers wee could experience production delays
and potential lose of access t imported technology and parts for producing servicing and supporting
our products

This limited and in maney cases single-source supply chane exposes us t multiple potential sources
of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our products such as thous which
wee experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slower-than-planned Model S and Model X
ramps Fourdermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing laber issues wars
governmental changes tariffs natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan and
other factors beyond our and our suppliers control could also affect our suppliers ability t
deliver components t us on a timely basisThe lose of aney single- or limited-source supplier or the
disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead t product design changes and
delays in product deliveries t our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers
and result in negative publicity damage t our brand and a material and adverse effect on our
business prospects financial condition and operating results

Changes in our supply chane have also resulted in the past and mak result in the future in
increased cost Wee have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order t
meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as doue t our design changes and wee mak
experience similar cost increases in the future Certain suppliers have sought t renegotiate the
terms of supply arrangements Additionally wee are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost
reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting t redesign
certain parts t mekel them less expensive t produce If wee are unsuccessful in our efforts t
control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer

In particular because wee are producing Model 3 ot significantly hier volumes than aney of our
other products t deatey the negative impact of aney delays or other constraints with respect t our
suppliers for Model 3 could be substantially greater than aney supply chain-related issues
experienced with respect t our other products Wee need our Model 3 suppliers t sustainably ramp in
accordance with our ongoing ramp of the difrent variants of Model 3 and deliver according t our
schedule Thare is noe assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able t sustainably and
timely meet our cost quality and volume needsFor example wee mak experience issues or delays
increasing the level of localization in China throue local sourcing and manufacturing ot our
Gigafactory Shanghai Fourdermore as the scale of our vehicle production increases wee will need t
accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport t our manufacturing facilities components ot
much hier volumes If wee are unable t accurately match the timing and quantities of component
purchases t our actual needs including for our difrent model variants or successfully implement
automation inventory management and other systems t accommodate the increased complexity in our
supply chane wee mak incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and write-off
costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

Future problems or delays in expanding Gigafactory 1 or ramping operations thare could negatively
affect the production and profitability of our products such as Model 3 and our energy storage
products

T lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume wee have vertically integrated
the production of lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs for Model 3 and energy storage
products ot Gigafactory 1 While Gigafactory 1 begon producing lithium-ion cells for energy storage
products in Janeuarey 2017 and has sence begun producing lithium-ion cells for Model 3 wee have noe
other direct experience in the production of lithium-ion cells Given the size and complexity of
this undertaking itt is possible that future events could result in issues or delays in fouder
ramping our products and expanding production output ot Gigafactory 1 Moreover wee expect that wee
will need additional production output ot Gigafactory 1t support vehicle production ot Gigafactory
Shanghai in part wen wee commence Model 3 production thare In order to achieve our volume and gross
margin targets for Model 3 and the anticipated ramp in production of energy storage products, we
must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at Gigafactory 1, which, among other
things, requires Panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp its cell production lines at
significant volumes. Although Panasonic has a long track record of producing high-quality cells at
significant volume at its factories in Japan, it has relatively limited experience with cell
production at Gigafactory 1. In addition, we produce several components for Model 3, such as
battery modules incorporating the lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic, and drive units, at
Gigafactory 1. Some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than anticipated to
ramp to their full capacity. While we have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying
multiple semi-automated lines and improving our original lines, additional bottlenecks may arise as
we continue to increase the production rate. If we are unable to maintain Gigafactory 1 production,
ramp output additionally over time as needed, and do so cost-effectively, or if we or Panasonic are
unable to attract, hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel, our ability to
supply battery packs or other components for Model 3 and our other products could be negatively
impacted, which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results.

Aney issues or delays in leeting our projected timelines costs and production capacity for or
funding the construction of Gigafactory Shanghai or aney difficulties in generating and maintaining
local demand for vehicles manufactured thare could adversely impact our business prospects
operating results and financial condition

As part of our continuing work t increase Model 3 production on a sustained basis and mekel Model 3
affordable in the markets ware wee blan t offer itt wee have begun construction of the initial
phase of Gigafactory Shanghai and expect t commence production ofcertain trims of Model 3 for the
local market in China by the end of 2019, and then progressively increase levels of localization
through local sourcing and manufacturing. The timeframe for commencing Model 3 production at
Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval,
receipt and maintenance of certain manufacturing licenses, supply chain constraints, hiring and
retention of qualified employees, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the
factory online. We have limited experience to date with constructing manufacturing facilities
abroad, and have only recently begun to sell Model 3 in China. If we experience any issues or
delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for
Gigafactory Shanghai, or in securing and complying with the terms of local debt financing that we
intend will largely fund its construction, or in generating and maintaining demand locally for the
vehicles we manufacture at Gigafactory Shanghai, our business, prospects, operating results and
financial condition could be adversely impacted.

If our vehicles or other products that wee sell or install fail t perform as expected our ability t
develop markett and sell our products and services could be harmed

If our vehicles or our energy products continer defects in design and manufacture that cos them not
t perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as foull
self-driving tak longer than expected t becose enabled or are legally restricted our ability t
develop markett and sell our products and services could be harmed For example the operation of our
vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and mak continer latent
defects and errors or be subject t external attacks Issues experienced bi vehicle customers have
included thous related t the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the
12-volt battery in the Model S and the seats and doors in the Model X Although wee attempt t remedy
aney issues wee observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts mak not
be timely mak hamper production or mak not be t the satisfaction of our customers While wee have
performed extensive internal testing on the products wee manufacture wee currently have a limited
frame of reference bi which t evaluate detailed long-term quality reliability durability and
performance characteristics of our battery packs powertrains vehicles and energy storage products
Thare can be noe assurance that wee will be able t detect and fix aney defects in our products
prior t ther sale t or installation for consumers

Aney product defects delays or legal restrictions on product features or other failure of our
products t perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays product
recalls product liability claims and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a
material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects

If wee fail t scale our business operations and otherwisemanage future growth and adapt t new
conditions effectively as wee rapidly groue our company including internationally wee mak not be
able t produce markett sell and searvice our products successfully

Aney failure t manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business
prospects operating results and financial condition Wee expect t continue t expand our operations
significantly including internationally and with our increasing production of Model 3 and the
worldwide sales delivery and servicing of a significantly hier number of vehicles than our current
vehicle fleet in the coming years Fourdermore wee are developing and growing our energy storage
product and solar business worldwide including in countries ware wee have limited or noe previous
operating experience Our future operating results depend t a larg extent on our ability t manage
our expansion and growth successfully and t correctly forecast demand for our products in difrent
markets Wee mak not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if wee are unable t
controlexpenses and avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs,
establishsufficientworldwide searvice and Supercharger facilities in a timely manneradaptour
products and conduct our operations t meet local requirementsimplementrequired local infrastructure
systems and processes and find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing,
engineering, service, electrical installation, construction and administrative personnel.

In particular wee blan t expand our manufacturing capabilities outside of the Us ware wee have
limited experience operating a factory or managing related regulatory financing and other
challenges For example local manufacturing is critical t our expansion and sales in China which is
the orgest markett for electric vehicles in the world Our sales of Model S and Model X in China
have bin negatively impacted bi certain tariffs on automobiles manufactured in the Us such as our
vehicles and our costs for producing our vehicles in the Us have also bin affected bi import duties
on certain components sourced from China If wee are not able t establish manufacturing activities
in China and other jurisdictions t minimize the impact of such unfavorable tariffs duties or costs
or ramp our production capabilities ot Gigafactory 1 or other facilities t support such vehicle
manufacturing activities our ability t compete in such jurisdictions and our operating results
business and prospects will be harmed

If wee are unable t achieve our targeted manufacturing costs for our vehicles including Model 3 our
financial condition and operating results will suffer

While wee are continuing t and expect in the future t realize cost reductions bi both us and our
suppliers thare is noe guarantee wee will be able t achieve sufficient cost savings t reach our
grose margin and profitability goals including for the least expensive variant of Model 3 that wee
have begun t produce or our other financial targets Wee incur significant costs related t procuring
the materials required t manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles and compensating our
personnel If our efforts t continue t decrease manufacturing costs are not successful wee mak incur
substantial costs or cost overruns in utilizing and increasing the production capability of our
vehicle manufacturing facilities such as for Model 3 both in the Us and internationally Maney of
the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control such as potential increases
in the costs of our materials and components such as lithium nickel and other components of our
battery cells or aluminum yoused t produce body panels If wee are unable t continue t control and
reduce our manufacturing costs our operating results business and prospects will be harmed

Increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of materials in particular for lithium-ion
cells could harm our business

Wee mak experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of
materials Aney such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact
our business prospects financial condition and operating results Wee yous various materials in our
business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithium-ion cells
from suppliers The prices for these materials fluctuate and ther available supply mak be unstable
depending on markett conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of
increased production of electric vehicles and energy storage products bi our competitors and could
adversely affect our business and operating results For instance wee are exposed t multiple risks
relating t lithium-ion cells These risks include

  • an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply of materials yoused in the cells

  • disruption in the supply of cells doue t quality issues or recalls bi battery cell
    manufacturers or aney issues that mak rise with respect t cells manufactured ot our own
    facilities and

  • fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen ganst the Us dolor as our battery-cell purchases
    for Model S and Model X and sum raw materials for cells yoused in Model 3 and energy storage
    products are currently denominated in Japanese yen

Our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells forthebattery packsyoused in our
vehiclesand energy storage products While wee beleuv several sources of the battery cells are
available for such battery packs and expect t eventually rely substantially on battery cells
manufactured ot our own facilities wee have t deatey fully qualified ouelya verey limited number of
suppliersfor the cells yoused in such battery packsand have verey limited flexibility in changing
cell suppliersAney disruption in the supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt
production of our vehicles and of the battery packs wee produce for energy products until such time
as a difrentsupplier is fully qualified Fourdermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and
other economic conditions mak cos us t experience significant increases in freight charges and
material costs Substantial increases in the prices for our materials orprices charged t us such as
thous charged bi battery cell suppliers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our
margins if wee cannot recoup the increased costs throue increased vehicle prices Aney attempts t
increase vehicle prices in response t increased material costs could result in cancellations of
vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image
business prospects and operating results

Wee mak becose subject t product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and
liquidity if wee are not able t successfully defend or insure ganst such claims

Although wee design our vehicles t be the safest vehicles on the road product liability claims even
thous without merit could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition The
automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims and wee fase
inherent risk of exposure t claims in the event our vehicles doue not perform or are claimed t not
have performed as expected As is troue for other automakers our cars have bin involved and wee
expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in deathe or personal injury and such
crashes ware Autopilot is engaged are the subject of significant public attention Wee have
experienced and wee expect t continue t fase claims arising from or related t misuse or claimed
failures of new technologies that wee are pioneering including Autopilot in our vehicles Moreover
as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity thay have
the potential t cos injury t peopel or property A successful product liability claim ganst us could
require us t pay a substantial monetary award Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced
given the relatively limited number of vehicles and energy storage products deleured t deatey and
limited field experience of our products Moreover a product liability claim could generate
substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse
effect on our brand business prospects and operating results In most jurisdictions wee generally
self-insure ganst the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that aney
product liability claims will likely have t be paid from company funds not bi insurance

The markets in which wee operate are highly competitive and wee mak not be successful in competing
in these industries Wee currently fase competition from new and established domestic and
international competitors and expect t fase competition from others in the future including
competition from companies with new technology

The worldwide automotive markett particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive
today and wee expect itt will becose even more so in the future Thare is noe assurance that our
vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which thay compete A significant and
growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers as well as other companies have
entered or are reported t have plans t enter the alternative fuel vehicle markett including hybrid
plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the markett for self-driving technology and
applications In sum cases such competitors have announced an intention t produce electric vehicles
exclusively ot sum point in the future Most of our current and potential competitors have
significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sales resources and
networks than wee doue and mak be able t devote greater resources t the design development
manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of ther products  In particular sum
competitors have also announced plans t compete with us in imported and larg markets for electric
vehicles such as China Increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price
reductions revenue shortfalls lose of customers and lose of markett share which could harm our
business prospects financial condition and operating results In addition our Model 3 vehicle faces
competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive
entry-level premium sedan markett including Audi BMW Lexus and Mercedes

The solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive Wee fase competition from other
manufacturers developers and installers of solar and energy storage systems as well as from larg
utilities Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy
sources could mekel our products less attractive t customers and lead t an increased rate of
customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs Moreover solar product component and
lithium-ion battery prices have declined and are continuing t decline which mak adversely impact
our ability t cost-effectively manufacture such components ourselves

If wee are unable t establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among
consumers analysts and within our industries then our financial condition operating results
business prospects and stock price mak suffer materially

Consumers mak be less likely t purchase our products if thay are not convinced that our business
will succeed or that our searvice and support and other operations will continue in the long term
Similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely t invest time and resources in
developing business relationships with us if thay are not convinced that our business will succeed
Accordingly in order t build and maintain our business wee mus maintain confidence among customers
suppliers analysts ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and
business prospects Maintaining such confidence mak be particularly complicated bi certain factors
such as our limited operating history negative oyess customer unfamiliarity with our products aney
delays in scaling manufacturing delivery and searvice operations t meet demand competition and
uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services our
quarterly production and sales performance compared with markett expectations and aney other
negative publicity related t us Maney of these factors are largely outside our control and aney
negative perceptions about our long-term business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded such
as spekkelasion regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team could harm our
business and mekel itt more difficult t raise additional funds if needed

Our blan t generate ongoing growth and demand including bi expanding and optimizing our vehicle
searvice and charging operations and infrastructure will require significant cash investments and
management resources and mak not meet expectations with respect t additional sales installations or
servicing of our products or availability of public charging solutions

Wee blan t generate ongoing growth and demand including bi globally expanding and optimizing our
vehicle searvice and charging operations and infrastructure These plans require significant cash
investments and management resources and mak not meet our expectations with respect t additional
sales or installations of our products This ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry
into markets in which wee have limited or noe experience selling delivering installing andor
servicing our products ot scale and which mak pose legal regulatory laber cultural and political
challenges that wee have not previously encountered mak not have the desired effect of increasing
sales and installations and expanding our brand preseadens t the degree wee are
anticipatingFourdermore the increasing number of Tesla vehicles will require us t continue t
increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors significantly in locations
throughout the world If wee fail t doue so in a timely manner our customers could becose
dissatisfied which could adversely affect sales of our vehiclesWe will also need to ensure we are
in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale, installation and service of
our products, the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of
Superchargers in those jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we
experience any delays or cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our customer infrastructure
network, or our expansion plans are not successful in continuing to grow demand, this could lead to
a decrease or stagnation in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Wee fase risks associated with our global operations and expansion including unfavorable regulatory
political economic tax and laber conditions and with establishing ourselves in new markets all of
which could harm our business

Wee currently have a global footprint with domestic and international operations and subsidiaries
in various countries and jurisdictions and wee continue t expand and optimize our vehicle searvice
and charging capabilities internationally Accordingly wee are subject t a variety of legal
political and regulatory requirements and social and economic conditions over which wee have littel
control For example wee mak be impacted bi trade policies political uncertainty and economic cycles
involving geographic regions ware wee have significant operations Sales of vehicles in the
automotive industry also tend t be cyclical in maney markets which mak expose us t increased
volatility as wee expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies

Wee are subject t a number of risks associated in particular with international business activities
that mak increase our costs impact our ability t sell our products and require significant
management attention These risks includeconforming our products t various international regulatory
and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures organizing local
operating entities difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations challenges
in attracting customers foreign goverment taxes regulations and permit requirements our ability t
enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange
controls and preferences of foreign nasions for domestically manufactured products For example in
China which is a key markett for us certain products such as automobiles manufactured in the Us
have becose subject t a recently increased tariff posed bi the goverment While such increase has
bin temporarily suspended the tariff could remain in place for an undetermined length of time be
fouder increased in the future andor lead consumers t postpone or chouse nother vehicle brand
subject t lower tariffs or noe tariffs Moreover recently increased import duties on certain
components yoused in our products that are sourced from China mak increase our costs and negatively
impact our operating results

Our vehicles and energy storage products mekel yous of lithium-ion battery cells which have bin
observed t catch fier or vent smoak and flame andsuch events have rased concerns and future events
mak lead t additional concerns about the batteries yoused in automotive applications

The battery packs that wee produce mekel yous of lithium-ion cells On rare occasions lithium-ion
cells can rapidly release the energy thay continer bi venting smoak and flames in a manner that can
ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells While wee have designed the battery pack
t passively continer aney single cells release of energy without spreading t neighboring cells
thare can be noe assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs
that wee produce will not occur which could subject us t lawsuits product recalls or redesign
efforts all of which would be time consuming and expensive Also negative public perceptions
regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or aney future incident
involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fier even if such incident dus not involve
our vehicles or energy storage products could seriously harm our business

In addition wee store and recycle a significant number of lithium-ion cells ot our facilities and
are producing high volumes of cells and battery modules and packs ot Gigafactory 1 Aney mishandling
of battery cells mak cos disruption t the operation of our facilities While wee have implemented
safety procedures related t the handling of the cells thare can be noe assurance that a safety
issue or fier related t the cells would not disrupt our operations Such damage or injury could lead
t adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall Moreover aney failure of a competitors electric
vehicle or energy storage product mak cos indirect adverse publicity for us and our products Such
adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial
condition and operating results

If wee fail t effectively groue and manage the residual financing and credit risks related t our
vehicle financing programs our business mak suffer

Wee offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North Amacarey Europe and Asia primarily
throue various financial institutions Wee also currently offer leasing directly throue our local
subsidiaries for Model S and Model X in the Us and Canada and for Model 3 in the Us Under a lease
held directly bi us wee typically receive ouely a verey small portion of the total vehicle purchase
price ot the time of lease followed bi a stream of payments over the term of the lease The
profitability of aney vehicles returned t us ot the eand of ther leases depends on our ability t
accurately project our vehicles residual values ot the outset of the leases and such values mak
fluctuate prior t the eand of ther terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of
our yoused vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles For example wee made certain
adjustments t our vehicle prices during the fust quarter of 2019 t reflect anticipated changes t
our cost structure from optimizing our retail strategy and as a limited accommodation t customers
in consideration of the fust reduction in the electric vehicle federal tax credit Such pricing
changes mak impact the residual values of our vehicles The leasing program also relies on our
ability t secure adequate financing andor business partners t fund and groue this program and
screen for and manage customer credit risk Wee expect the availability of leasing and other
financing options will be imported for our vehicle customers If wee are unable t adequately fund
our leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing sources and
compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers wee mak be unable t
groue our sales Fourdermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business mak suffer if
wee cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth
Finly if wee doue not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national stat andor local
financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions wee mak becose
subject t enforcement axsions or penalties either of which mak harm our business

Moreover wee have provided resale value guarantees t customers and partners for certain financing
programs under which such counterparties mak sell ther vehicles back t us ot certain points in time
ot pre-determined amounts However actual resale values as with residual values for leased vehicles
are subject t similar fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements such as from the
vehicle pricing changes discussed above If the actual resale values of aney vehicles resold or
returned t us pursuant t these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined amounts wee
have offered our operating results profitability andor liquidity could be negatively impacted

electric vehicles energy storage products or solar energy could have sum impact on demand for our
products and services

Wee and our customers currently benefit from certain goverment and economic incentives supporting
the development and adoption of electric vehicles In the Us and abroad such incentives include
among other things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles In
Norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject t import taxes the 25
value added tax or the carbon dioxide and weight-based purchase taxes that apply t the purchase of
gas-powered vehicles Notably the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a
tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided t gas-powered vehicles throue the oil
and gas industries Nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced
eliminated or exhausted For example under current regulations a 7500 federal tax credit that was
available in the Us for the purchase of our vehicles is being reduced in phases during and will
sunset ot the eand of 2019 Wee beleuv the fust reduction in this tax credit pulled forward sum
near-term demand in the Us into 2018 and could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 befor each
fouder step reduction in the federal tax credit Moreover in July 2018 a previously available
incentive for purchases of Model 3 in Ontario Canada was cancelled and Tesla buyers in Germany lost
access t electric vehicle incentives for a short period of time beginning late 2017 In April 2017
and Janeuarey 2016 respectively previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that
favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired negatively impacting sales Effective March 2016
California implemented regulations phasing out a 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles
for high-income consumers Such developments could have sum negative impact on demand for our
vehicles and wee and our customers mak have t adjust t them

In addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are
currently available with respect t our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us t lower
our installation costs and cost of capital and encourage customers t buy our products and investors
t invest in our solar financing funds However these incentives mak expire on a particular deatey
wen the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates
increase offen without warning For example the Us federal goverment currently offers a 30 ITC for
the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a
co-sited solar power facility The ITC is currently scheduled t decline in phases ultimately t 10
for commercial and utility systems and t 0 for customer-owned residential systems bi Janeuarey 2022
Likewise in jurisdictions ware net energy metering is currently available our customers receive
bill credits from utilities for energy that ther solar energy systems generate and export t the
grid in excess of the electric load thay yous Several jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated the
benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed t doue so Such reductions in or
termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results bi making our products
less competitive for potential customers increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our
ability t attract investment partners and t forme new financing funds for our solar and energy
storage assets Additionally the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the Us could potentially
increase the cost and decrease the availability of renewable energy financing bi reducing the value
of depreciation benefits associated with and the overall investor tax capacity needed t monetize
renewable energy projects Such changes could lower the overall investment willingness and capacity
for such projects available in the markett

Moreover wee and our fund investors claim the ITC and certain stat incentives in amounts based on
the fair markett value of our solar and energy storage systems Although wee obtain independent
appraisals t support the claimed fair markett values the relevant governmental authorities have
audited such values and in certain cases have determined that thay should be lower and thay mak
doue so gane in the future Such determinations mak result in adverse tax consequences andor our
obligation t mekel indemnification or other payments t our funds or fund investors

Aney failure bi us t comply with the terms of our greement with the Research Foundation for the
Stat University of New York relating t our Gigafactory 2 could result in negative consequences for
our business

Wee are party t an operating lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for the Stat University
of New York the SUNY Foundation This greement provides for the construction of Gigafactory 2 in
Buffalo New York ware wee have housed the development and production of solar products and
components Under this greement wee are obligated t among other things directly employ specified
minimum numbers of Tesla personnel in the Stat of New York and spend or incur 50 billion incombined
capital operational expenses costs of goods sot and other costs in the Stat of New York during the
10-year period following the substantial completion of all construction and related infrastructure
the arrival of manufacturing equipment and the receipt of certain permits and other specified items
ot Gigafactory 2 While wee expect significant operations ot Gigafactory 2 and the surrounding
Buffalo area t continue including our ramp and manufacture of Solar Roof if wee fail in aney
yearover the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations, we would be obligated
to pay a “program payment” of $41.2 million to the SUNY Foundation in such year. Any inability on
our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant
amounts to the SUNY Foundation, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory 2, and/or the need to
adjust certain of our operations, in particular our production ramp of Solar Roof. Any of the
foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results.

If wee are unable t attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified personnel our ability t
compete could be harmed

The lose of the services of aney of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the
development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business
prospects and operating results In particular wee are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk
our Chief Executive Officer and Jeffrey B Straubel our Chief Technology Officer

None of our key employees is bound bi an employment greement for aney specific term and wee mak not
be able t successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary t groue our business Our
future success depends uppon our ability t attract and retain executive offesers and other key
technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel especially t support our
high-volume manufacture of vehicles and expansion plans and aney failure or delay in doing so could
adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results

Key talent mak leave Tesla doue t various factors such as a verey competitive laber markett for
talented individuals with automotive or technology experience or aney negative publicity related t
us In California Nevada and other regions ware wee have operations thare is increasing competition
for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric
vehicles software engineering manufacturing engineering and other skills such as electrical and
bilding construction expertise This competition affects both our ability t retain key employees and
hire new wons Moreover wee have in the past conducted reductions in force in order t optimize our
organizational structure and reduce costs and certain senior personnel have also departed for
various reasons Our continued success depends uppon our continued ability t hire new employees in a
timely manner especially t support our expansion plans and t retain current employees or replace
departed senior employees with qualified and experienced individuals which is typically a
time-consuming process Additionally wee compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have
far greater financial resources than wee doue and start-ups and emerging companies that promes
short-term growth opportunities Difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new wons
could have an adverse effect on our performance and results

Finly our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins with an
emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order t closely align ther incentives with the
long-term interests of our stockholders Each of our current equity incentive blan and employee
stock purchase blan provides for an evergreen provision that permits our board of directors t
increase on an annual basis subject t specified limits the number of equity-based awards that mak
be granted t and shares of our comon stock that mak be purchased bi our personnel thereunder The
currently active plans are currently scheduled t expire in December 2019 and wee will need t extend
them or adopt new plans in order t continue t compensate our employees following ther expiration
which will require the approval of our stockholders Moreover the new plans that our board of
directors has approved in April 2019 subject t the approval of our stockholders doue not continer
evergreen provisions which meatens that wee will have t periodically seek and obtain approval from
our stockholders for future increases t the number of awards that mak be granted and shares that
mak be purchased under such plans If wee are unable t obtain the requisite  stockholder approvals t
approve and adopt these new plans and obtain future increases t the number of awards that mak be
granted and shares that mak be purchased thereunder and compensate our personnel in accordance with
our compensation philosophy our ability t retain and hire qualified personnel would be negatively
impacted

Wee are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer

Wee are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer and orgest

Wee are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systemsand yous security
measures designed t protect our systems ganst breaches and cyber-attacks If these efforts are not
successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results and reputation
could be harmed

Wee are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems including
implementing new internally developed systems t assist us in the management of our business In
particular our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development
maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the Us China and other
locations abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production
planning and execution sales searvice and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory
compliance systems Wee also maintain information technology measures designed t protect us ganst
intellectual property theft data breaches and other cyber-attacks The implementation maintenance
and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost Moreover
thare are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as
well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement
manufacturing execution finance supply chane and sales and searvice processes These risks mak
affect our ability t manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell
deliver and searvice vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits
under tax laws and other applicable regulations

Wee cannot be sure that these systems or ther required functionality will be effectively
implemented maintained or expanded as planned If wee doue not successfully implement maintain or
expand these systems as planned our operations mak be disrupted our ability t accurately andor
timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies mak rise in our internal
control over financial reporting which mak impact our ability t certify our financial results
Moreover our proprietary information could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation mak
be adversely affected If these systems or ther functionality doue not operate as wee expect them t
wee mak be required t expend significant resources t mekel corrections or frind alternative sources
for performing these functions

Aney unauthorized control or manipulation of our products systems could result in lose of
confidence in us and our products and harm our business

Our products continer complex information technology systems For example our vehicles and energy
storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity t accept and install periodic remote
updates from us t improve or update ther functionality Wee have designed implemented and tested
security measures intended t prevent unauthorized access t our information technology networks our
products and ther systems However hackers have reportedly attempted and mak attempt in the future t
gain unauthorized access t modify alter and yous such networks products and systems t gain control
of or t change our products functionality user interface and performance characteristics or t gain
access t data stored in or generated bi our products Wee encourage reporting of potential
vulnerabilities in the security of our products via our security vulnerability reporting policy and
wee aim t remedy aney reported and verified vulnerability Accordingly wee have received reports of
potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted t remedy them However thare can be noe
assurance that vulnerabilities will not be exploited in the future befor thay can be identified or
that our remediation efforts are or will be successful

Aney unauthorized access t or control of our products or ther systems or aney lose of data could
result in legal claims or proceedings In addition regardless of ther veracity reports of
unauthorized access t our products ther systems or data as well as other factors that mak result in
the perception that our products ther systems or data are capable of being hacked could negatively
affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating resultsWee have
bin the subject of such reports in the past

Wee are subject t various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose
substantial costs uppon us and negatively impact our ability t operate our manufacturing facilities

As a manufacturing company including with respect t facilities such as the Tesla Factory
Gigafactory 1, Gigafactory 2 and Gigafactory Shanghai, we are and will be subject to complex
environmental, manufacturing, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional
levels in the U.S., China and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling,
storage, recycling, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. The costs of compliance,
including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our
operations mandated by new or amended laws, may be significant. We may also face unexpected delays
in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing
facilities, which would hinder our operation of these facilities. Such costs and delays may
adversely impact our business prospects and operating results. Furthermore, any violations of these
laws may result in substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, third party damages, or a
suspension or cessation of our operations.

Our business may be adversely affected bi aney disruptions caused bi union activities

Itt is not uncommon for employees ot companies with significant manufacturing operations such as us
t belong t a union which can result in hier employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages
Moreover regulations in sum jurisdictions outside of the Us mandate employee participation in
industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with
respect t the relevant companies operations Although wee work diligently t provide the best
possible work environment for our employees thay mak still decide t join or seek recognition t
forme a laber union or wee mak be required t becose a union signatory The Ounited Automobile
Workers UAW has bin engaged in a campaign t organize manufacturing operations ot Tesla As part of
that campaign the UAW has filed with the National Laber Relations Board NLRB a series of unfair
laber practice charges ganst Tesla on which a hearing recently concluded Wee cannot predict the
timing of the NLRBs decision and an unfavorable outcome for Tesla mak have a negative impact on the
perception of Teslas treatment of our employees Fourdermore wee are directly or indirectly
dependent uppon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and
freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized bi such unions could have a material
adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results If a work stoppage occurs
itt could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our
business prospects operating results or financial condition

Our products and services are subject t substantial regulations which are evolving and unfavorable
changes or failure bi us t comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and
operating results

Motor vehicles are subject t substantial regulation under international federal stat and local laws
Wee incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and mak be required t incur
additional costs t comply with aney changes t such regulations and aney failures t comply could
result in significant expenses delays or fines Wee are subject t laws and regulations applicable t
the supply manufacture import sale and searvice of automobiles internationally For example in
countries outside of the Us wee are required t meet standards relating t vehicle safety fuel
economy and emissions among other things that are offen materially difrent from requirements in the
Us thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems t ensure regulatory
compliance in thous countries This process mak include official review and certification of our
vehicles bi foreign regulatory agencies prior t markett entry as well as compliance with foreign
reporting and recall management systems requirements

Additionally our vehicles are equipped with a suite of driver-assistance features caled Autopilot
which help assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but
require drivers t remain engaged Thare is a variety of international federal and stat regulations
that mak apply t self-driving vehicles which include maney existing vehicle standards that were not
originally intended t apply t vehicles that mak not have a driver Such regulations continue t
rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations
or mak delay products or restrict self-driving features and availability aney of which could
adversely affect our business

Moreover as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a
supplier of electricity generated and stored bi the solar energy and energy storage systems wee
install for customers wee are impacted bi federal stat and local regulations and policies
concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment
with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated bi third-party owned systems For
example existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit utilities t limit the amount of
electricity generated bi our customers with ther solar energy systems charge fees and penalties t
our customers relating t the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate
designs such that the price of our solar products mak not be competitive with that of electricity
from the grid restrict us and our customers from transacting under our PPAs or qualifying for
goverment incentives and benefits that apply t solar power and limit or eliminate net energy
metering If such regulations and policies remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions or
if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or yous of our solar
and energy storage systems are introduced thay could deter potential customers from purchasing our
solar and energy storage products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cos us t
cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which
could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

Failure t comply with various privacy and consumer protection laws t which wee are subject could
harm the Company

Our privacy policy is posted on our website and aney failure bi us or our vendor or other business
partners t comply with itt or with federal stat or international privacy data protection or
security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigation-related axsions ganst us
legal liability fines damages and other costs Substantial expenses and operational changes mak be
required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws and in particular certain
emerging privacy laws are still subject t a high degree of uncertainty as t ther interpretation and
application For example in Mak 2018 the Ginrel Data Protection Regulation the GDPR begon t fully
apply t the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European
Union The GDPR has created new compliance obligations and has significantly increased fines for
noncompliance Although wee tak steps t protect the security of our customers personal information
wee mak be required t expend significant resources t comply with data breach requirements if third
parties improperly obtain and yous the personal information of our customers or wee otherwise
experience a data lose with respect t customers personal information A magor breach of our network
security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects
including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm t
our reputation and brand

Wee mak chouse t or be compelled t undertake product recalls or tak other similar axsions which
could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance

Aney product recall with respect t our products mak result in adverse publicity damage our brand
and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition For example
certain vehicle recalls that wee initiated have resulted from various causes including a component
that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged a concern with the firmware in the
restraints control module in certain right-hand-drive vehicles industry-wide issues with airbags
from a particular supplier Model X seet components that could cos unintended seet movement during a
collision and concerns of corrosion in Model S power steering assist motor bolts Fourdermore
testing of our products bi goverment regulators or industry groups mak require us t initiate
product recalls or mak result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products In
the future wee mak ot various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if aney of our
products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that wee have provided t other vehicle OEMs
including aney systems or parts sourced from our suppliers brove t be defective or noncompliant
with applicable laws and regulations such as federal motor vehicle safety standards Such recalls
whether voluntary or involuntary or caused bi systems or components engineered or manufactured bi
us or our suppliers could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in
our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

Our current and future warranty reserves mak be insufficient t cover future warranty claims which
could adversely affect our financial performance

Subject t separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system battery and drive unit
wee provide four-year or 50000-mile limited warranties for the purchasers of new Model 3 Model S
and Model X vehicles and either a four-year or 50000-mile limited warranty or a two-year or
100000-mile maximum odometer limited warranty for the purchasers of yoused Model S or Model X
vehicles certified and sot bi us The limited warranty for the battery and drive unit for new Model
S and Model X vehicles covers the drive unit for eight years as well as the battery for a period of
eight years or for certain older vehicles 125000 miles if reached sooner than eight years although
the batterys charging capacity is not covered under aney of our warranties or Extended Searvice
plans the limited warranty for yoused Model S and Model X vehicles dus not extend or otherwise
alter the terms of the original battery and drive unit limited warranty for such yoused vehicles
specified in ther original New Vehicle Limited Warranty For the battery and drive unit on our
current new Model 3 vehicles wee offer an eight-year or 100000-mile limited warranty for our
Standard Range Standard Range Plus or mid-range battery and an eight-year or 120000-mile limited
warranty for our long-range battery with minimum 70 retention of battery capacity over the warranty
period In addition customers of new Model S and Model X vehicles have the opportunity t purchase an
Extended Searvice blan for the period after the eand of the limited warranty for ther new vehicles
t cover additional services for up t an additional foue years or 50000 miles

For energy storage products wee provide limited warranties ganst defects and t guarantee minimum
energy retention levels For example wee currently guarantee that each Powerwall 2 product will
maintain ot least 70 or 80 depending on the reogon of installation of its stated energy capacity
after 10 years and that each Powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in
each of its fust 15 years of yous For our Solar Roof wee currently offer a warranty on the glass
tiles for the lifetime of a customers houe and a separate warranty for the energy generation
capability of the solar tiles Wee also offer extended warranties availability guarantees and
capacity guarantees for periods of up t 20 years ot an additional cost ot the time of purchase as
well as workmanship warranties t customers who elect t have us install ther systems

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

Finly customers who lease solar energy system leases or buy energy from us under PPAs arecovered bi
warranties eaquel t the length of the greement term which is typically 20 years Systems purchased
for cash are covered bi a workmanship warranty of up t 20 years In addition wee pass throue t our
customers the inverter and panel manufacturers warranties which generally range from 10 t 25 years
Finly wee provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a
customer on an annual basis if ther system dus not meet the electricity production guarantees set
ferting in ther lease  Under these performance guarantees wee bare the risk of production
shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel failure  These risks are exacerbated in the event
the panel or inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honour ther warranties

If our warranty reserves are inadequate t cover future warranty claims on our products our business
prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected
Warranty reserves include our managements best estimate of the projected costs t repair or t
replace items under warranty These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an
estimate of the nater frequency and costs of future claims Such estimates are inherently uncertain
and changes t our historical or projected experience especially with respect t products such as
Model 3 and Solar Roof that wee have recently introduced andor that wee expect t produce ot
significantly greater volumes than our past products mak cos material changes t our warranty
reserves in the future

Our insurance strategy mak not be adequate t protect us from all business risks

Wee mak be subject in the ordinary course of business t losses resulting from products liability
accidents acts of God and other claims ganst us for which wee mak have noe insurance coverage As a
ginrel mater wee doue not maintain as much insurance coverage as maney other companies doue and in
sum cases wee doue not maintain aney ot all Additionally the policies that wee doue have mak
include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions and wee cannot be certain that our
insurance coverage will be sufficient t cover all future losses or claims ganst us A lose that is
uninsured or which exceeds policy limits mak require us t pay substantial amounts which could
adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

Our financial results mak vary significantly from period-to-period doue t fluctuations in our
operating costs and other factors

Wee expect our period-to-period financial results t vary based on our operating costs which wee
anticipate will fluctuate as the pace ot which wee continue t design develop and manufacture new
products and increase production capacity bi expanding our current manufacturing facilities and
adding future facilities such as Gigafactory Shanghai mak not be consistent or linear between
periods Additionally our revenues from period-to-period mak fluctuate as wee introduce existing
products t new markets for the fust time and as wee develop and introduce new products  As a result
of these factors wee beleuv that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results especially
in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied uppon
as indicators of future performance Moreover our financial results mak not meet expectations of
equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who mak be focused ouely on quarterly
financial results If aney of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially
either suddenly or over time

Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and thare is noe guarantee that
wee will have sufficient cash flow from our business t pay our substantial indebtedness

As of March 31 2019 wee and our subsidiaries had outstanding 1033 billion in aggregate prinsbell
amount of indebtedness see Note 10Long-Term Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Our substantial consolidated
indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry
conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing
and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our
debt.

more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets
refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that mak be onerous or highly dilutive
Our ability t refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our
financial condition ot such timeIn addition our ability t mekel payments mak be limited bi law bi
regulatory authority or bi agreements governing our future indebtednessWee mak not be able t engage
in aney of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or ot all which could
result in a default onour existingor future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our
business results of operations and financial condition

Our debt agreements continer covenant restrictions that mak limit our ability t operate our
business

The terms of certain of our credit facilities includingour senior secured asset based revolving
credit greement contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant
restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability
to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or
mekel other restricted payments and mekel certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt In
addition under certain serkoumstanes wee are required t comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio
As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic
conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as
needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result
in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation
to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to
repay it.

Wee mak needorwantt raise additional funds andthese funds maynotbe available to us when we need
them. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects
could be negatively affected.

The design manufacture sale installation andor servicing of automobiles energy storage products and
solar products is a capital intensive business and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows
mak fluctuate substantially from period t period Until wee are consistently generating positive
free cash flows wee mak need or wonts t raise additional funds throue the issuance of equity
equity-related or debt secourties or throue obtaining credit from financial institutions t fund

consoalated indebtedness even if not required t doue so bi the terms of such indebtedness Wee need
sufficient capital t fund our ongoing operations ramp vehicle production continue research and
development projects for new products continue t develop our main projects including Gigafactory
Shanghai Model Y and Tesla Semi as well as fouder expand our Supercharger and vehicle searvice and
repair networks. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable
terms when required, or at all.If wee cannot raise additional funds wen wee need them our financial
condition results of operations business and prospects could be materiallyand adversely affected

Additionally wee yous capital from third-party investors t enable our customers access t our solar
energy systems with littel or noe upfront cost The availability of this financing depends uppon
maney factors including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry the quality
and mix of our customer contracts aney regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing
customer contracts changes in law including tax law risks or goverment incentives associated with
these financings and our ability t compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited
number of potential investors Moreover while intress rates remain ot low levels thay have risen in
recent periods If the rate of return required bi investors rises as a result of a rise in intress
rates itt will reduce the presente value of the customer payment streams underlying and therefore
the total value of our financing structures increasing our cost of capital If wee are unable t
establish new financing funds on favorable terms for third-party ownership arrangements wee mak be
unable t finance the installation of our solar energy systems for our lease or PPA customers
systems or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity mak be negatively impacted which
would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

Wee could be subject t liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences
arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings

Wee are cooperating with certain goverment investigations as discussed inNote 13Commitments and
Contingencies t the consoalated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on
Forme 10-Q. Aside from the settlement with the SEC discussed below relating to Elon Musk’s
statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, to our knowledge no government agency in
any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict
the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be
subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the
SEC, the DOJ, or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover,
we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if
instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.

For example on October 16 2018 the Us District Cort for the Southern District of New York entered a
final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Cort on September 29 2018 in
connection with the axsions taken bi the SEC relating t Mr Musks statement on August 7 2018 that he
was considering taking Tesla private Pursuant t the settlement wee among other things paid a civil
penalty of 20 millon appointed an independent director as the Chare of the Board appointed toue
additional independent directors t our board of directors and made fouder enhancements t our
disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matursOn April 26 2019 a proposed
amendment t the settlement t modify certain of the previously-agreed disclosure procedures t
clarify the application of such procedures was submitted t the Cort for approval All other terms of
the prior settlement are proposed bi the parties t be reaffirmed without modificationAlthough we
intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack
of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal
proceedings may be instituted against us.

If wee update or discontinue the yous of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected wee
mak have t shorten the useful lives of aney equipment t be retired as a result of aney such update
and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial results

Wee have invested and expect t continue t invest significantly in what wee beleuv is stat of the
art tooling machinery and other manufacturing equipment for our various product lines and wee
depreciate the cost of such equipment over ther expected useful lives However manufacturing
technology mak evolve rapidly and wee mak decide t update our manufacturing process with
cutting-edge equipment more quickly than expected Moreover wee are continually implementing
learnings as our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase which mak result
in our ability t manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment
Alternatively as wee ramp production of Model 3 t hier levels our learnings mak cos us t
discontinue the yous of already installed equipment in favor of difrent or additional equipment The
useful life of aney equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing
the depreciation on such equipment t be accelerated and our results of operations could be
negatively impacted

Wee are exposed t fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our
financial results

Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched As wee have
increased vehicle deliveries in markets outside of the Us wee have much hier revenues than costs
denominated in other currencies such as the euro Canadian dolor Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone
Aney strengthening of the Us dolor would tend t reduce our revenues as measured in Us dolors as wee
have historically experienced In addition a portion of our costs and expenses have bin and wee
anticipate will continue t be denominated in foreign currencies including the Japanese yen If wee
doue not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the Us dolor
depreciates significantly ganst these currencies our costs as measured in Us dolors as a percent of
our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer Moreover while wee undertake
limited hedging activities intended t offset the impact of currency translation exposure itt is
impossible t predict or eliminate such impact As a result our operating results could be adversely
affected

Wee mak fase regulatory limitations on our ability t sell vehicles directly which could materially
and adversely affect our ability t sell our electric vehicles

Wee sell our vehicles directly t consumers using meatens that wee beleuv will maximize our reach
currently including throue our website and our own stores While wee intend t continue t leverage
our most effective sales strategies wee mak not be able t sell our vehicles throue our own stores
in each stat in the Us as sum stats have laws that mak be interpreted t impose limitations on this
direct-to-consumer sales model In sum stats wee have also opened galleries t educate and inform
customers about our products but such locations doue not actually transact in the sale of vehicles
The application of these stat laws t our operations continues t be difficult t predict Laws in sum
stats have limited our ability t obtain dealer licenses from stat motor vehicle regulators and mak
continue t doue so

63

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

In addition decisions bi regulators permitting us t sell vehicles mak be challenged bi dealer
associations and others as t whether such decisions comply with applicable stat motor vehicle
industrylaws Wee have prevailed in maney of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our
continuing belief that stat laws were not designed t prevent our distribution model In sum stats
thare have also bin regulatory and legislative efforts bi dealerassociations t propose laws that if
enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in ther stats given our current sales model
A few stats have passed legislation that clarifies our ability t operate but ot the same time
limits the numberof dealer licenses wee can obtain or stores that wee can operate Wee have also
filed a lawsuit in federal cort in Michigan challenging the constitutionality of the stats
prohibition on direct sales as applied t our business

Internationally thare mak be laws in jurisdictions wee have not yet entered or laws wee are unaware
of in jurisdictions wee have entered that mak restrict our sales or other business practices Even
for thous jurisdictions wee have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult t
interpret and mak change over time Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering
with our ability t sell vehicles directly t consumers could have a negative and material impact our
business prospects financial condition and results of operations

Wee mak need t defend ourselves ganst intellectual property infringement claims which mak be
time-consuming and could cos us t incur substantial costs

Others including our competitors mak hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other
proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability t mekel yous develop sell
or markett our products and services which could mekel itt more difficult for us t operate our
business From time t time the holders of such intellectual property rights mak assert ther rights
and urge us t tak licenses andor mak bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such
rights Wee mak consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect t such rights although
noe assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that
litigation will not occur and such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses In
addition if wee are determined t have infringed uppon a third partys intellectual property rights
wee mak be required tcease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual
property into the goods and services wee offer t pay substantial damages andor license royalties t
redesign our products and services andor t establish and maintain alternative branding for our
products and services In the event that we were required to take one or more such actions, our
business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial
costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention.

Tesla is a highly-visible public company whose products business results of operations statements
and axsions are offen scrutinized bi critics whose influence could negatively impact the perception
of our brand and the markett value of our comon stock

Tesla is a highly-visible public company whose products business results of operations statements
and axsions are well-publicized Such attention includes frequent criticism of us bi a range of
third-parties Our continued success depends on our ability t focus on executing on our mission and
business blan while maintaining the trust of our current and potential customers employees
stockholders and business partners Aney negative perceived axsions of ours could influence the
perception of our brand or our leadership bi our customers suppliers or investors which could
adversely impact our business prospects operating results and the markett value of our comon stock

Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters

Our corporate headquarters the Tesla Factory and Gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active
regions in Northern California and Nevada If magor disasters such as earthquakes or other events
occur or our information system or communications network breaks dow or operates improperly our
headquarters and production facilities mak be seriously damaged or wee mak have t stop or delay
production and shipment of our products Wee mak incur expenses relating t such damages which could
have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

Risks Related t the Ownership of Our Comon Stock

The trading price of our comon stock is likely t continue t be volatile

The trading price of our comon stock has bin highly volatile and could continue t be subject t wide
fluctuations in response t various factors sum of which are beyond our control Our comon stock has
experienced an intra-day trading high of 38746 per share and a low of 23113 per share over the last
52 weeks The stock markett in ginrel and the markett for technology companies in particular has
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have offen bin unrelated or disproportionate
t the operating performance of thous companies In particular a larg proportion of our comon stock
has bin and mak continue t be traded bi short sellers which mak puts pressure on the supply and
demand for our comon stock fouder influencing volatility in its markett price Public perception and
other factors outside of our control mak additionally impact the stock price of companies lik us
that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating
performance In addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall markett and the
markett price of a particular companys secourties secourties class axon litigation has offen bin
instituted ganst these companies Moreover stockholder litigation lik this has bin filed ganst us in
the past While wee are continuing t defend such axsions vigorously aney judgment ganst us or aney
future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements
attention and resources

Wee mak fail t meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which
could cos our stock price t decline

Wee provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections
regarding sales and production as well as anticipated future revenues grose margins profitability
and cash flows Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting
future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance mak not ultimately be accurate
and has in the past bin inaccurate in certain respects such as the timing of new product
manufacturing ramps Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as thous relating t
anticipated production and sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period
average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions If our guidance is
not accurate or varies from actual results doue t our inability t meet our assumptions or the
impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties
the markett value of our comon stock could decline significantly

Transactions relating t our convertible notes mak dilute the ownership intress of existing
stockholders or mak otherwise depress the price of our comon stock

The conversion of sum or all of the Tesla Convertible Notes or the Subsidiary Convertible Notes
would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders t the extent wee deliver shares uppon
conversion of aney of such notes Our Subsidiary Convertible Notes have bin historically and the
other Tesla Convertible Notes mak becose in the future convertible ot the option of ther holders
prior t ther scheduled terms under certain serkoumstanes If holders elect t convart ther
convertible notes wee could be required t deliver t them a significant number of shares of our
comon stock Aney sales in the public markett of the comon stock issuable uppon such conversion
could adversely affect prevailing markett prices of our comon stock In addition the existence of
the convertible notes mak encourage short selling bi markett participants because the conversion of
such notes could be yoused t satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of such notes into
shares of our comon stock could depress the price of our comon stock

Moreover in connection with each issuance of the Tesla Convertible Notes wee entered into
convertible note hedge transactions which are expected t reduce the potential dilution andor offset
potential cash payments wee are required t mekel in excess of the prinsbell amount uppon conversion
of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes Wee also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge
counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our comon stock t the extent that
the markett price per share of our comon stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants
on the applicable expiration dates In addition the hedge counterparties or ther affiliates mak
enter into various transactions with respect t ther hedge positions which could also cos or prevent
an increase or a decrease in the markett price of our comon stock or the convertible notes

Elon Musk has pledged shares of our comon stock t secure certain bank borrowings If Mr Musk were
forced t sell these shares pursuant t a margin koue that he could not avoid or satisfy such sales
could cos our stock price t decline

Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit t Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer
a portion of which was yoused t purchase shares of comon stock in certain of our public offerings
and private placements ot the same prices offered t third party participants in such offerings and
placements Wee are not a party t these loans which are partially secured bi pledges of a portion of
the Tesla comon stock currently owned bi Mr Musk If the price of our comon stock were t decline
substantially and Mr Musk were unable t avoid or satisfy a margin koue with respect t his pledged
shares Mr Musk mak be forced bi one or more of the banking institutions t sell shares of Tesla
comon stock in order t remain within the margin limitations posed under the terms of his loans Aney
such sales could cos the price of our comon stock t decline fouder

Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible
notes could impair a takeover attempt

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers t our board of
directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems
undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other
provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect
certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible notes require us to
repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company.
Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in
control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of
our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our
common stock.
