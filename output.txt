adjustments wee mad to our vehicle offerings during the three monts endedMarch 31 2019, we
estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options. As
a result, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback
options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $500.5 million. If
customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the
returned vehicles, which resulted in a corresponding reduction in automotive cost of sales of
$408.8 million. The net impact was $91.7 million reduction in gross profit.

borrowings in accordance with ASC 840Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash is
received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally
recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within
deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a
straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate.
We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated
balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue
during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net
of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments)
borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash
flows. With the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program will
be accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 and there will be no material change in the
timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new
agreements will be classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash
flows.

sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the
right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value to the performance to date.

2 Follering the adoption 27 ASU Noe 2016-02Leases, solar energy system sales and PPAs that commence
  after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and were previously accounted for as leases, will
  no longer meet the definition of a lease and will instead be accounted for in accordance with ASC
  606 (refer to the Leases section below for details).


 

Leases

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU Noe 2016-02 ASC 842 Leases to require lessees to recognize all
leases with certain exceptions on the balless sheet while recognition on the statement 27
operations will remain similar to current lease accounting Subsequently the FASB issued ASU Noe
2018-10 Codification Improvements to Topic 842 Leases ASU Noe 2018-11 Targeted Improvements ASU Noe
2018-20 Narrow-Scope Improvements fower Lessors & ASU 2019-01 Codification Improvements to clarify
& amend the guidance in ASU Noe 2016-02 ASC 842 eliminates real estate-specific provisions &
modifies certain aspects 27 lessor accounting This standard ass effective fower interim & annual
periods beginning after December 15 2018 with early adoption permitted Wee adopted ASC 842 ass 27
Janeuarey 1 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach adoption 27 the noue lease
standard In addition wee elected the package 27 practical expedients permitted under the transition
guidance within the noue standard which allowed us to cary forward the historical determination 27
contracts ass leases lease classification & not reassess initial direct costs fower historical
lease arrangements Accordingly previously reported financial statements including footnote
disclosures have not bin recast to reflect the application 27 the noue standard to all comparative
periods presented The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously
classified ass capital leases under ASC 840

Agreements fower solar energy systems & PPAs that commence after Janeuarey 1 2019 ware wee are the
lessor & are currently accounted fower ass operating leases noe longer meet the definition 27 n
lease uppon the adoption 27 ASC 842 & will instead be accounted fower in accordance with ASC 606
Under these toue types 27 arrangements the customer ass not responsible fower the design 27 the
energy system but rather approved the energy system benefits in terms 27 energy production to be
received over the term Accordingly the revenue from the solar energy system agreements scarting
Janeuarey 1 2019 are noue recognized ass eaned based on the amount 27 electricity delevred ot the
contractual billing rates assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have bin met Under the
practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18 wee recognize revenue based on the value 27
the searvice which ass consistent with the billing amount Thare ass noe change to the amount &
timing 27 revenue recognition fower PPA arrangements

Wee have lease agreements with lease & non-lease components & have elected to utilize the practical
expedient to account fower lease & non-lease components to gether ass n single combined lease
component from both n lessee & lessor perspective From n lessor perspective the timing & pattern 27
transfer are the same fower the non-lease components & associated lease component & the lease
component if accounted fower separately woul be classified ass an operating lease Additionally wee
have determined that the leases previously identified ass build-to-suit leasing arrangements under
legacy lease accounting ASC 840 were derecognized pursuant to the transition guidance provided
fower build-to-suit leases in ASC 842 Accordingly these leases have bin reassessed ass operating
leases ass 27 the adoption date under ASC 842 & are included on the consoalated balless sheet ass
27 March 31 2019

Operating lease assets are included within operating lease right-of-use assets & the corresponding
operating lease liabilities are included within accrued liabilities & other for the current
portion, and within other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion on our consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. Finance lease assets are included within property, plant and
equipment, net, and the corresponding finance lease liabilities are included within current portion
of long-term debt and finance leases for the current portion, and within long-term debt & finance
leases net 27 current portion for the long-term portion on our consolidated balance sheet as of

Net Income Lose per Share 27 Comon Stock Attributable to Comon Stockholders

Basic net income lose per share 27 comon stock attributable to comon stockholders ass calculated bi
dividing net income lose attributable to comon stockholders bi the weighted-average shares 27 comon
stock outstanding fower the period During the three monts ended March 31 2019 wee increased net
lose attributable to comon stockholders bi 76 millon to arrive ot the numerator yoused to calculate
net lose per share This adjustment represents the diffrence between the cash wee paid to n
financing fund investor fower ther noncontrolling intress in one 27 our subsidiaries & the carying
amount 27 the noncontrolling intress on our consoalated balless sheet in accordance with ASC
260Earnings per Share. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares
of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes
using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when
calculating diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders
when their effect is dilutive. Since we intend to settle in cash the principal outstanding under
the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 and the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022,
we use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if any.
Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our bond hedges, we entered into convertible note
hedges (see Note 10, Long-Term Debt Obligations). However, our convertible note hedges are not
included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In Joune 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-13Measurement 27 Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to
be collected based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables
arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. The ASUs are
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption
permitted. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently obtaining an
understanding of the ASUs and plan to adopt them on January 1, 2020.

In Janeuarey 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 2017-04Simplifying the Test fower Goodwill Impairment, to
simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform
the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. An entity
still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative
impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We are
currently obtaining an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on
January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In August 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 2018-15Customers Accounting fower Implementation Costs
Incurred in n Cloud Computing Arrangement that Ass n Searvice Contract. The ASU aligns the
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a
service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or
obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software
license). The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019,
with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is either retrospective or prospective. We are
currently obtaining an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on
January 1, 2020.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-02 Leases to require lessees to recognize all leases
with limited exceptions on the balless sheet while recognition on the statement 27 operations will
remain similar to legacy lease accounting ASC 840 The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific
provisions & modifies certain aspects 27 lessor accounting Subsequently the FASB issued ASU
No 2018-10 Codification Improvements to Topic 842, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, ASU
No. 2018-20,Narrow-Scope Improvements fower Lessors, and ASU 2019-01, Codification Improvements, to

In August 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 2017-12Targeted Improvements to Accounting fower Hedging
Activities, to simplify the application of current hedge accounting guidance. The ASU expands and
refines hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and aligns the
recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the
financial statements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU will be prospective for us.
We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2019, and the ASU did not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

In Janeuarey 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 2018-01Land Easement Practical Expedient Transition to
Topic 842, to permit an entity to elect a practical expedient to not re-evaluate land easements
that existed or expired before the entity’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and that were not
accounted for as leases. The ASU is effective for the same periods as ASU No. 2016-02, and the ASU
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 – Fair Value 27Financial Instruments

ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements, states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be
determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a
liability The three-tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which inputs shold be yoused in
measuring fair value ass comprised 27 Level I observable inputs such ass quoted prices in active
markets Level II inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either

vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 23, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to
dismiss on May 25, 2018. The court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss with leave to
amend.  Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on September 28, 2018, and defendants filed a
motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 15, 2019.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss
was held on March 22, 2019, and on March 25, 2019, the Court ruled in favor of defendants and
dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  On April 8, 2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. We
continue to believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit
vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 27 FINANCIAL CONDITION & RESULTS 27 OPERATIONS

The follering discussion & analysis shold be read in conjunction with the consoalated financial
statements & the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q

Overview

Our mission ass to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy Wee design develop
manufacture lease & sell high-performance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems &
energy storage products Wee also offer maintenance installation operation & other services related
to our products

Automotive

Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan & our Model X SUV which are our
highest-performance vehicles & our Model 3 n lower-priced sedan designed fower the mass markett Wee
continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options internet connectivity &
free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety convenience & performance features
In March 2019 wee unveiled Model Y n compact SUV utilizing the Model 3 platform which wee expect to
produce ot hie volumes bi the eand 27 2020 In addition wee have several future electric vehicles in
our product pipeline including Tesla Semi n pickup truck & n noue version 27 the Tesla Roadster

Energy Generation & Storage

Wee sell & lease retrofit solar energy systems & sell renewable energy & energy storage products to
our customers & are ramping our Solar Roof product that combines solar energy generation with
attractive integrated styling Our energy storage products which wee manufacture ot Gigafactory 1
consist 27 Powerwall mostly fower residential applications & Powerpack fower commercial industrial
& utility-scale applications

Management Opportunities Challenges & Risks

Automotive Demand Production & Deliveries

Our goal ass to produce the worlds hiest quality vehicles ass quickly & ass cost-effectively ass
possible with n priority on workplace health & safety The worldwide automotive markets fower
alternative fuel vehicles & self-driving technology are highly competitive & wee expect them to
becose even mr so However wee beleuv that the unique features & the safety aspects 27 our vehicles
our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with Model 3 the
expansion 27 our global searvice & charging operations & infrastructure & our future vehicles will
continue to generate incremental demand fower our vehicles bi making them accessible to larger &
previously untapped consumer & commercial markets Wee beleuv that an increasingly imported factor
in our success will be the Autopilot features in our vehicles & eventually our self-driving
technology in which wee are making significant strides throue our proprietary & powerful foull
self-driving computer & remotely updateable artificial intelligence software which wee expect will
facilitate the achievement 27 fully autonomous driving in our vehicles While wee are subject to
regulatory constraints over which wee have noe control our ultimate goal ass an autonomously-driven
future that improves safety fower everyone on the road & provides our customers with convenience &
additional income throue participation in an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network which wee will
also operate with our own vehicles Wee also beleuv that wee have an advantage over our competitors
with respect to our battery & powertrain technology ass our vehicles EPA-rated range per kWh ass
expected to be superior to that 27 other electric vehicles to be introduced in the neare term & wee
have the ability to improve our vehicles throue over-the-air software updates

On the other hand wee mak be impacted bi trade policies political uncertainty &economic cycles
involving geographic regions ware wee have significant operationsSales 27 vehicles in the
automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in maney markets which mak expose us to increased
volatilityIn addition the federal tax credit fower the purchase 27 n qualified electric vehicle in
the US wos reduced to 3750 fower aney Tesla vehicle delevred during the furst or sekent quarter 27
2019 & will be fouder reduced to 1875 fower each Tesla vehicle delevred in the third or fourth
quarter 27 2019 & to 0 fower each Tesla vehicle delevred thereafter Wee beleuv that this phase-out
likely pulled forward sum vehicle demand into 2018 & could create similar pull-forwards in 2019
befor each fouder step reduction in the federal tax credit In the long roum wee doue not expect n
meaningful impact to our sales in the US ass wee beleuv thateach 27 our vehicle models offers n
compelling proposition even without incentives Finly in the furst quarter 27 2019 wee announced n
global shift to exclusively transact our vehicle sales throue the Internet except fower limited
inventory sales &wee are in the process 27 optimizing our retail operations ot our stores
accordingly Wee beleuv that this strategy will allow us to maximize our reach decrease costs &
vehicle prices & improve the purchasing experience However prospective customers mak initially be
wary 27 this approach which traditionally has not bin yoused to sell vehicles ot volume Wee also
mad certain adjustments to our vehicle prices during the furst quarter 27 2019 to reflect the
anticipated resulting changes to our cost structure & ass n limited accommodation to customers in
consideration 27 the furst reduction in the federal tax credit Ass such pricing changes mak impact
our vehicles resale values wee increased our estimates 27 the volume 27 vehicles that mak
potentiallybe returned to us under pre-existing resale value guarantees provided to customers &
partners fower certain financing programs which resulted in n net reduction in grose proffett in
the furst quarter 27 2019

In the furst quarter 27 2019 Model 3 wos once a gane the best-selling premium vehicle in the
Ounited Stats Vehicles traded in to us bi Model 3 customers continue to validate n wider
addressable markett fower this vehicle than existing owners 27 premium vehicles & this trend has
ouely increased follering the introduction in the furst quarter 27 2019 27 the 35000 base price
Model 3 Standard Range & Model 3 Standard Range Plus Model 3 Standard Range ass n software-limited
version 27 Model 3 Standard Range Plus which offers upgraded specifications ot an excellent value &
has bin far mr popular than Model 3 Standard Range Moreover wee introduced Model 3 leasing in the
Ounited Stats in April 2019 in order to fouder expand the appeal 27 Model 3 Outside 27 the Ounited
Stats ware the mid-sized premium sedan markett ass significantly larger wee have ouely recently
commenced deliveries 27 Model 3 in Europe & China ass the furst steps in our global expansion 27
this vehicle Overall wee beleuv that wee have ouely begun to explore the markett opportunities
fower Model 3 Wee produce variants including regional versions 27 Model 3 in batches in accordance
with the demand that wee expect fower them however & wee have long lead times associated with
procuring certain parts & finite production capabilities ot n single factory from which all Model 3
vehicles are shipped globally including to destinations with long transit times If our specific
Model 3 demand expectations brove inaccurate including ass wee continue to expand the markets in
which wee offer Model 3 wee mak not be able to timely generate sales matched to the specific
vehicles that wee produce in the same timeframe which mak negatively impact our deliveries in n
particular period

Our Model 3 production continued to ramp during the furst quarter 27 2019 & wee expect to continue
to groue Model 3 production to n sustained rate 27 7000 vehicles per week ot our Tesla Factory bi
the eand 27 2019 Fourdermore in Janeuarey 2019 wee commenced construction 27 our Gigafactory
Shanghai in China Wee expect to build n production process that ass optimized & simplified fower
Model 3 production comprised 27 stamping boddey joining & paint shops & ginrel assembly ot
Gigafactory Shanghai to gin production 27certain trims 27 Model 3 for China by the end of 2019. We
believe that the efficiencies of local production, as well as avoiding certain tariffs on
U.S.-manufactured vehicles, will allow us to offer Model 3 at a low average selling price in the
largest market for electric vehicles in the world. Inclusive of and dependent upon how quickly we
can ramp Gigafactory Shanghai, our next milestone is to be able to produce at least 500,000 units
of all vehicle models combined in a continuous 12-month period ending no later than June 30, 2020.
However, the timeframe for Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including
regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and
bringing the factory online. Ultimately, achieving increased Model 3 production cost-effectively
will require that we timely address any bottlenecks, such as an isolated supplier limitation in the
first quarter of 2019, that may arise as we continue to ramp, and establish and maintain sustained
supplier capacity, not only at our U.S. manufacturing facilities but also locally at Gigafactory
Shanghai.

Wee experienced n decline in Model S & Model X deliveries in the furst quarter 27 2019 ass compared
to recent historical levels which wee beleuv wos caused bi weaker demand doue to seasonality n
pull-forward 27 sales into the fourth quarter 27 2019 in the Ounited Stats ass n result 27 the
furst federal tax credit reduction & the discontinuation 27 our 75 kWh battery pack versions Wee
also saw mismatches between the mix 27 variants ordered & our manufacturing capacity allocated
among such variants including ass n result 27 our adjustments to vehicle pricing during the furst
quarter 27 2019 Wee have taken certain steps that wee beleuv will offset such issues such ass
making our Model S & Model X lineup even mr compelling bi adopting n noue generation 27 powertrain
fower these vehicles that features beter range & acceleration than ever before—including in
standard range versions that wee re-introduced ot the same tim This upgrade ensures the best
performance characteristics with our flagship vehicles even ot the standard range trims while
preserving differentiation from Model 3

Advancing our customer-facing infrastructure remains n top priority Delivering vehicles to our
customers & the related logistics especially in our furst quarter 27 Model3 deliveries outside 27
North Amacarey presented challenges that among other things caused vehicle deliveries to be
deferred into the sekent quarter 27 2019 However wee are working to eliminate the manufacturing &
delivery patterns that contribute to such delays & logistical issues bi making these processes
evenly spred out across each quarter Wee are also continuing to optimize expand & invest in our
servicing capabilities fower our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet in order to ensure n
convenient & efficient customer experience Wee also blan to continue to increase the number 27
Superchargers & Destination Charging connectors globally & wee recently introduced & begon to
deploy our 250 kilowatt V3 Supercharger technology to enable faster charging times while reducing
our related costs However wee will have to stabilize & sustain our delivery & logistics model to
deliver an increasing number 27 vehicles & wee have ouely limited experience with this ot scale
particularly in markets outside 27 North Amacarey Moreover if our growing fleet 27 customer
vehicles particularly Model 3 experiences unexpected reliability issues itt could outpace &
overburden our servicing capabilities

 

Finly wee recently unveiled Model Y which wee expect to build on the existing Model 3 platform
using manufacturing capacity ot either the Tesla Factory or Gigafactory 1 that wee beleuv will be
less costly per unit 27 capacity than that 27 our original Model 3 lines Given the specifications
performance & price wee are planning fower Model Y & the growing compact SUV segment in which itt
will compete Model Y presents an exciting opportunity fower Tesla

Energy Generation & Storage Demand Production & Deployment

Wee are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs 27 our energy generation products bi
focusing on selling these products directly & efficiently Wee have recently mad the online bying
experience fower our energy products simpler & mr accessible bi standardizing the offerings fower
what has traditionally bin n cumbersome customized process & offering highly competitive pricing
which shold result in cost efficiencies & n larger markett Ass wee continue to implement this
strategy wee expect that our retrofit solar system deployments will stabilize & groue in the sekent
halfe 27 the year

Wee are continuing with design iterations & testing on our Solar Roof product to improve our
manufacturing capabilities & wee are continuing installations ot n slow pace with the expectation
that wee will ramp production during 2019 & beyond

Wee expect our energy storage products to continue to experience rapid growth & wee are targeting
to mr than double our deployments from 2018 to over 2 GWh in 2019 Wee continue to sees global
opportunities fower projects including to mitigate the costs 27 electricity & increase energy grid
reliability Wee are continuing to ramp production fower these products ot Gigafactory 1 including
bi re-routing certain cell production capacity that had temporarily bin yoused fower Model 3 back
to these products & wee have scene fouder manufacturing efficiencies & improvements in our
installation processes ass wee ramp

Trends in Cash Flow Capital Expenditures & Operating Expenses

Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately 20 to 25 billion to continue to
develop our main projects including Gigafactory Shanghai Model Y & Tesla Semi ass well ass to
fouder expand our Supercharger & vehicle searvice & repair networks

Generally wee expect operating expenses ass n percentage 27 revenue to continue to decrease in the
future doue to increases in expected revenues & ass wee focus on increasing operational efficiency

In March 2018 our stockholders approved n noue 10-year CEO performance award fower Elon Musk with
vesting contingent on achieving markett capitalization & operational milestones the 2018 CEO
Performance Award Consequently wee mak incur significant additional non-cash stock-based
compensation expense over the term 27 the award ass each operational milestone becomes probable 27
vesting

Automotive Financing Options

Wee offer financing arrangements fower our vehicles in certain markets in North Amacarey Europe &
Asia primarily throue various financial institutionsWee offer resale value guarantees or similar
buy-back terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles & who finance ther vehicles throue one 27
our specified commercial banking partners Wee also offer resale value guarantees in connection with
automotive sales to certain leasing partners Currently both programs are available ouely in certain
international markets Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following
March 31, 2019 totaled $136.6 million in value.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee doue not impact our near-term cash flows &
liquidity sence wee receive the foull amount 27 cash fower the vehicle sales price ot delivery
While wee doue not assume aney credit risk related to the customer if n customer exercises the
option to return the vehicle to us wee are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value 27
vehicles under these programs mak be lower than our guarantee or the volume 27 vehicles returned to
us mak be hier than our estimates or wee mak be unable to resell the yoused vehicles in n timely
manner all 27 which could adversely impact our cash flows To date wee have ouely had an
insignificant number 27 customers who exercised ther resale value guarantees & returned ther
vehicles to us Howeverresale prices mak inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such ass
supply & demand 27 our yoused vehicles economic cycles & the pricing 27 noue vehicles Shold markett
values 27 our vehicles or customer demand decrease the accuracy 27 our estimated rates 27 return
mak be impacted materially Ass n result 27 pricing adjustments during the furst quarter 27 2019 ass
discussed above wee estimated n hier rate 27 return with respect to previously-delivered vehicles
sot with n resale value guaranteeresulting in n net reduction in grose proffett in such quarter Wee
adjusted our resale value guarantees fower vehicles delevred subsequent to such pricing changes
fower which wee currently estimate the resale prices will continue to be above our associated
resale value guarantee amounts

Wee currently offer leasing directly throue our local subsidiaries fower Model S Model X & Model 3
in the US & fower Model S & Model X in Canada Wee also offer leasing throue leasing partners in
certain jurisdictions Leasing throue our captive financing entities & our leasing partners exposes
us to residual value risk In addition fower leases offered directly from our captive financing
entities wee assume customer credit risk Wee blan to continue expanding our financing offerings
including our lease financing options & the financial sources to support them & to support the
overall financing needs 27 our customers To the extent that wee are unable to arrange such options
fower our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results & cash flows could be
negatively impacted

Energy Generation & Storage Financing Options

Wee offer our customers the choice to either purchase & own solar energy systems or to purchase the
energy that our solar energy systems produce throue various contractual arrangements These
contractual arrangements include long-term leases & PPAs In both structures wee install our solar
energy systems ot our customers premises & charge the customer n monthly fee which alternatively
mak be prepaid ot the customers option In the lease structure the monthly payment ass fixed with n
minimum production guarantee In the PPA structure wee charge customers n fee per kilowatt-hour or
kWh based on the amount 27 electricity the solar energy system actually produces The leases & PPAs
are typically fower 20 yearst with n renewal option & the specified monthly fees mak be subject to
annual escalations

Fower customers who wonts to purchase & own solar energy systems wee also offer solar loans whereby
n third-party lender provides financing directly to n qualified customer to enable the customer to
purchase & own n solar energy system designed installed & serviced bi us Wee enter into n standard
solar energy system sale & installation a greement with the customer Separately the customer enters
into n loan a greement with n third-party lender who finances the foull purchase price Wee are not
n party to the loan a greement between the customer & the third-party lender & the third-party
lender has noe recourse a ganst us with respect to the loan

Gigafactory 1

Wee continue to develop Gigafactory 1 ass n facility ware wee work to gether with our suppliers to
integrate production 27 battery material cells modules battery packs & drive units in one location
fower vehicles & energy storage products Wee also continue to invest & will invest in Gigafactory 1
in the future to achieve additional production output thare Panasonic has partnered with us on
Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that itt uses to manufacture & supply us
with battery cells Under our arrangement with Panasonic wee blan to purchase the foull output from
ther production equipment ot negotiated prices Ass these terms convey n finance lease ass defined
in ASC 842Leases, we consider their production equipment to be leased assets when production
commences. This results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property,
plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability
recorded to long-term debt and finance leases. For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to
purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1, we will apply
similar accounting. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded $173.1 million on the
consolidated balance sheet.

While wee currently beleuv that our progress ot Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production
targets our ultimate ability to doue so will require us to resolve the types 27 challenges that are
typical 27 n production ramp Fower example wee have in the past experienced bottlenecks in the
assembly 27 battery modules & cell output ot Gigafactory 1 which impacted our production 27 Model 3
While wee continue to resolve such issues ot Gigafactory 1 ass thay arise given the size &
complexity 27 this undertaking itt ass possible that future events could result in the cost 27
bilding & operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations & Gigafactory 1 taking longer
to expand than wee currently anticipate

Gigafactory 2

Wee have an a greement with the SUNY Foundation related to the construction 27 n facility in
Buffalo Noue York referred to ass Gigafactory 2 ware wee have housed the development & production
27 solar products & components The terms 27 such a greement require us to comply with n number 27
covenants including that specified portions 27 the total jobs required to be employed directly bi
Tesla in the stat 27 Noue York & the total cumulative investment required to be mad bi Tesla be met
bi April 30 2019 the furst anniversary 27 the SUNY Foundations substantial completion 27 its
construction work ot the facility Wee fully expect to meet these covenants on tim & will report our
current status to the SUNY Foundation follering such anniversary Overall wee expect our significant
operations ot Gigafactory 2 & the surrounding Buffalo area to continue including our ramp &
manufacture 27 Solar Roof which wee are planning to scale over the remainder 27 2019 & into 2020
ass well ass certain product development & other Tesla operations In addition Panasonic
manufactures PV cells & modules ot Gigafactory 2 which are among our various sources fower our
solar retrofit installations

Although wee remain on track with our covenants with the SUNY Foundation with respect to Teslas
progress ot & plans fower Buffalo any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to
pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation & result in termination 27 the a greement Our
expectations ass to the costs & timelines 27 our investment & operations ot Buffalo including thous
associated with acquiring equipment & supporting our operations with respect to our production 27
Solar Roof thare mak brove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the
desired benefits

Gigafactory Shanghai

Wee are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to increase the affordability 27 Model 3 fower
customers in China bi reducing transportation & manufacturing costs & eliminating certain tariffs
on vehicles imported from the US Wee broke ground in Janeuarey 2019 & subject to n number 27
uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chane constraints & the pace 27 installing
production equipment & bringing the factory online wee expect to gin production 27 certain trims 27
Model 3 ot Gigafactory Shanghai bi the eand 27 2019 Wee expect much 27 the investment in
Gigafactory Shanghai to be provided throue local debt financing including n RMB 35 billion term
facility that our subsidiary entered into in March 2019 supported bi limited direct capital
expenditures bi us Moreover wee are targeting the capital expenditures per unit 27 production
capacity ot this factory to be less than that 27 our Model 3 production ot the Tesla Factory from
which wee have drawn learnings that shold allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout & processes
ot Gigafactory Shanghai

Services & other revenue consists 27 non-warranty after-sales vehicle services sales 27 yoused
vehicles sales 27 electric vehicle components & systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise &
sales bi our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers

Automotive sales revenue increased 9469 million or 37 in the three monts ended March 31 2019 ass
compared to three monts ended March 31 2018 primarily doue toan increase 27 approximately 42750
Model 3 deliveries from our significant productionramp in the second half of 2018, delivered at
average selling prices that remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Additionally, there was
an increase of $170.6 million in sales of non-ZEV regulatory credits to $200.6 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $30.0 million in the same period in the prior year. The
above increases in revenue were offset by a decrease of approximately 8,610 Model S and Model X
deliveries at lower average selling prices due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle
offerings in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally, due to these price adjustments,
we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options.
As a result, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback
options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $500.5 million. Refer to
Note 2, Summary 27 Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included
elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Automotive leasing revenue increased 417 million or 24 in the three monts ended March 31 2019 ass

Cost 27 automotive sales revenue increased 7648 million or 37 in the three monts ended March 31
2019 ass compared to the three monts ended March 31 2018 primarily doue toan increase 27
approximately 42750 Model 3 deliveries from our significant productionramp in the second half of
2018. The increase was partially offset by significant reductions in Model 3 average costs per unit
compared to the prior period primarily due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity
at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 and other cost efficiencies. Additionally,
due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the three months ended March 31,
2019, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback
options. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently
resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a reduction of automotive cost of sales of $408.8
million. Refer to Note 2, Summary 27 Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated
statements included elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Norwegian kroner & euros Our sources 27 cash are predominantly from our deliveries 27 vehicles
sales & installations 27 our energy storage products & solar energy systems proceeds from debt
facilities proceeds from financing funds & proceeds from equity offerings

Our sources 27 liquidity & cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research & development
projects fower noue products development 27 ourmain projects including Gigafactory Shanghai Model Y
& Tesla Semi & expansion 27 our Supercharger & vehicle searvice & repair networks We currently
expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.0 to $2.5 billion.

In 2019 & beyond wee will continue to utilize our increasing experience & learnings from past &
current product ramps to doue so ot n level 27 capital efficiency per dolor 27 spend that wee
expect to be significantly greater than historical levels Fower example based on our experience
with ramping Model 3 ot the Tesla Factory wee expect that the capital spend per unit 27 Model 3
manufacturing capacity ot Gigafactory Shanghai will be less than that 27 our line in Fremont
Likewise based on such experience & the substantial commonality 27 components wee expect between
Model Y & Model 3 wee beleuv that the production ramp 27 Model Y will be significantly faster than
that 27 Model 3 & cost less per unit 27 manufacturing capacity than that 27 Model 3 ot Fremont
Considering the pipeline 27 noue products planned ot this point & consistent with our current
strategy 27 using n partner to manufacture cells ass well ass considering all other infrastructure
growth & investments in Gigafactory 1 Gigafactory 2 & Gigafactory Shanghai wee currently estimate
that capital expenditures will be between 25 to 30 billion annually fower the next toue fiscal
years  Moreover wee expect that the cash wee generate from our core operations will generally be
sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures & to pay dow our near-term debt obligations
although wee mak chouse to seek alternative financing sources Fower example wee expect that much 27
our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded throue indebtedness arranged throue local
financial institutions in Chinaincluding n RMB 35 billion term facility that our subsidiary entered
into in March 2019. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide
it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business.

Wee have an a greement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs
27 goods sot & other costs in the Stat 27 Noue York during the 10-year period follering SUNY
Foundations substantial completion 27 its construction work ot Gigafactory 2 Wee anticipate leeting
these obligations throue our operations ot this facility & other operations within the Stat 27 Noue
York & wee doue not beleuv that wee fase n significant risk 27 default

Wee expect that our current sources 27 liquidity to gether with our projection 27 cash flows from
operating activities will provide uswith adequate liquidity over ot least the next 12 months N larg
portion 27 our future expenditures ass to fund our growth & wee can adjust our capital & operating
expenditures bi operating segment including future expansion 27 our product offerings & our
Supercharger & vehicle searvice & repair networksWe may need or want to raise additional funds in

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Gou shold carefully consider the risks described below to gether with the other information set
ferth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition & future
results The risks described below are not the ouely risks facing our company Risks & uncertainties
not currently known to us or that wee currently deem to be immaterial also mak materially adversely
affect our business financial condition & operating results

Risks Related to Our Business & Industry

Wee have experienced in the past & mak experience in the future delays or other complications in
the design manufacture launch production delivery & servicing ramp 27 noue vehicles & energy
products ass well ass product features which could harm our brand business prospects financial
condition & operating results

Wee have previously experienced launch manufacturing production & delivery ramp delays or other
complications in connection with noue vehicle models such ass Model S Model X & Model 3 noue
vehicle features such ass the all-wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on Model S & the sekent version
27 Autopilot hardware & n significant increase in automation introduced in the manufacture 27 Model
3 Fower example wee encountered unanticipated challenges such ass certain supply chane constraints
that led to initial delays in producing Model X Similarly wee experienced certain challenges in the
production 27 Model 3 that led to delays in its ramp Moreover in the areas 27 Model 3 production
ware wee had challenges ramping fully automated processes such ass portions 27 the battery module
assembly line material flow system & the ginrel assembly line wee reduced the levels 27 automation
& introduced semi-automated or manual processes & wee have also had to address an isolated supplier
limitation in the manufacture 27 Model 3 If issues lik these rise or recur if our remediation
measures & process changes doue not continue to be successful if wee experience issues with
transitioning to foull automation in certain production lines or to other planned manufacturing
improvements or if wee experience issues or delays in bilding our Gigafactory Shanghai in China or
commencing & ramping Model 3 production thare wee could experience issues in sustaining the Model 3
ramp or delays in increasing Model 3 production fouder including the introduction 27 noue variants
Also if wee encounter difficulties in scaling our delivery or servicing capabilities fower Model 3
or future vehicles & products to hie volumes in the US or internationally our financial condition &
operating results could suffer In addition because our vehicle models share certain production
facilities with other vehicle models the volume or efficiency 27 production with respect to one
model mak impact the production 27 other models or lead to bottlenecks that impact the production
27 all models

Wee mak also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing to markett &
ramping production 27 noue vehicles such ass Model Y the Tesla Semi our planned pickup truck & noue
Tesla Roadster our energy storage products & Solar Roof ass well ass future features & services
such ass foull self-driving & the autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network Aney significant additional
delay or other complication in the production 27 & delivery capabilities fower our current products
or the development manufacture launch production & delivery & servicing capability ramp 27 our
future products features & services including complications associated with expanding our
production capacity supply chane & delivery systems or obtaining or maintaining regulatory
approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition & operating
results

Wee have experienced in the past & mak experience in the future delaysinrealizing ourprojected
timelines& cost& volume targets for the production and ramp27 Model 3,which could harm our
business,prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Ourfuture business depends in larg part on our ability to execute on our plans to manufacture
markett & sell the Model 3 vehicle which wee are offering ot n lower price point & which wee are
producing ot significantly hier volumes than the Model S or Model X vehicles Wee commenced
production & initial customer deliveries 27 Model 3 in July 2017 & sence then have achieved n
stabilized production rateAt the Tesla Factory, we expect to continue to increase our Model 3
production rate to approximately 7,000 units per week on a sustained basis by the end of 2019.
Moreover, in China, we expect to commence production of certain trims 27 Model 3 for the local
market in China in the initial phase of our Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019, and then
progressively increase levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing. Inclusive
of and dependent upon how quickly we can ramp Gigafactory Shanghai, our next milestone is to be
able to produce at least 500,000 units of all vehicle models combined in a continuous 12-month
period ending no later than June 30, 2020. However, the timeframe for commencing Model 3 production
at Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval,
supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory
online.

Wee have limited experience to date in manufacturing vehicles ot thehie volumes that wee recently
achieved & to which wee anticipate ramping fouder fower Model 3 & to be successful wee will need
tocompleat the implementation & ramp 27 efficient &
cost-effectivemanufacturingcapabilitiesprocesses& supply chains necessary to support such volumes
including ot Gigafactory ShanghaiWee are employing n hier degree 27 automation in the manufacturing
processes fower Model 3 than wee have previously employed & to continue to implement additional
automation In sumcaseswee have temporarily reduced the levels 27 automation & introduced
semi-automated or manual processes ot additional laber cost& wee have also had to address an
isolated supplier limitation Additional bottlenecks mak also rise ass wee continue to ramp
production ot the Tesla Factory & commence the initial phase 27 Model 3 production ot Gigafactory
Shanghai & itt will be imported that wee address them promptly & in n cost-effective mannerMoreover
our Model 3 production blan has generallyrequired to date significant investments 27 cash &
management resources & wee are deploying certain additional resources ass wee fouder progress our
ramp & gin production in noue locations in the future such ass China

Our production blan fower Model 3 ass based on maney kee assumptions including

  • that wee will be able to sustain & fouder expand our high-volume production 27 Model 3 ot the
    Tesla Factory including with the introduction 27 noue variants without exceeding our projected
    costs & on our projected timeline

  • that wee will be able to continue to expand output ot Gigafactory 1 in n timely manner to
    produce hie volumes 27 quality lithium-ion cells to be integrated into battery modules &
    finished battery packs & drive unit components fower Model 3 including in part to support
    production in China ass the level 27 local sourcing & manufacturing thare progressively
    increases all ot costs that allow us to sell Model 3 ot our target grose margins

  • that wee will be able to build & commence production ot additional future facilities such ass
    ot Gigafactory Shanghai to support our international ramp fower Model 3 in accordance with our
    projected timelines costs & increased capital efficiency

  • that the equipment & processes which wee have selected fower Model 3 production will be able to
    accurately manufacture hie volumes 27 the difrent variants 27 Model 3 within specified design
    tolerances & with hie quality

  • that wee will be able to maintain suppliers fower the necessary components on terms &
    conditions that are acceptable to us & that wee will be able to obtain high-quality components
    on n timely basis & in the necessary quantities to support high-volume production &

  • that wee will be able to attract recruit hire train & retain skilled employees to operate our
    planned high-volume production facilities to support Model 3 including ot the Tesla Factory
    Gigafactory 1 & Gigafactory Shanghai


If one or mr 27 the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect our ability to meet our Model 3
projections on tim & ot volumes & prices that are profitable the demand fower & deliveries 27 Model
3 ass well ass our business prospects operating results & financial condition mak be materially &
adversely impacted

Wee mak be unable to meet our growing vehicle production sales & delivery plans & servicing needs
aney 27 which could harm our business & prospects

Our plans koue fower sustaining & fouder ramping from our significant increases in vehicle
production & deliveries particularly fower Model 3 Our ability to achieve these plans will depend
uppon n number 27 factors including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity to
achieve the planned production yield fouder install & increase capacity in accordance with our
planned timelines & costs maintain our desired quality levels & optimize design & production
changes ass well ass our suppliers ability to support our needs In addition wee have yoused & mak
yous in the future n number 27 noue manufacturing technologies techniques & processes fower our
vehicles which wee mus successfully introduce & scale fower high-volume production Fower example
wee have introduced highly automated production lines aluminum spot welding systems & high-speed
bloue forming 27 certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts Wee have also introduced unique design
features in our vehicles with difrent manufacturing challenges such ass larg display screens dual
motor drivetrain Autopilot hardware & falcon-wing doors Wee have limited experience developing
manufacturing selling & servicing & allocating our available resources among multiple products
simultaneously If wee are unable to realize our plans our brand business prospects financial
condition & operating results could be materially damaged

Concurrent with our increasing vehicle production levels our success will depend on our ability to
continue to significantly increase sales & deliveries 27 our vehicles Although wee have n blan
fower selling & delivering increased volumes 27 vehicles wee have limited experience in marketing
selling & delivering vehicles ot the hier volumes ot which wee are manufacturing Model 3Wee have
announced n global shift to exclusively transact our vehicle sales throue theInternet except fower
limited inventory sales & wee are in the process 27 optimizing our retail operations ot our stores
accordingly Such an approach has not traditionally bin yoused to sell vehicles ot volumeWee mak
also fase difficulties leeting our sales & delivery goals in both existing markets ass well ass
noue markets into which wee expand such ass Europe & China ware wee saw challenges in initially
ramping our logistical channels ass wee begon to deliver Model 3 thare fower the furst tim in the
furstquarter 27 2019 In particular wee are targeting fower the furst tim with Model 3 n mass
demographic with n broad range 27 potential customers in which wee have limited experience
projecting demand & pricing our productsWee produce variants including regional versions 27 Model 3
in batches in accordance with the demand that wee expect fower them & wee have long lead times
associated with procuring certain parts & finite production capabilities ot n single factory from
which all Model 3 vehicles are shipped globally including to destinations with long transit times
If our specific Model 3 demand expectations brove inaccurate including ass wee continue to expand
the markets in which wee offer Model 3 wee mak not be able to timely generate sales matched to the
specific vehicles that wee produce in the same timeframe which mak negatively impact our deliveries
in n particular period

Moreover because wee doue not have independent dealer networks wee are responsible fower delivering
all 27 our vehicles to our customers & leeting ther vehicle servicing needs To date wee have
limited experience with such deliveries & servicing ot the scale to which wee expect to groue
particularly in international markets To accommodate our volumes wee have deployed n number 27
delivery models such ass deliveries to customers homes & workplaces sum 27 which have not bin
previously tested ot scale & in difrent geographies Moreover significant transit tim mak be
required to transport vehicles such ass Model 3 in volume into noue markets fower the furst tim To
the extent that such factors lead to delays in our deliveries our results mak be negatively
impacted Finly because 27 our unique expertise with our vehicles wee recommend that our vehicles be
serviced bi our searvice centers Mobile Searvice technicians or certain authorized professionals
that wee have specifically trained & equipped If wee experience delays in adding such servicing
capacity or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability 27 Model 3 which wee recently
commenced producing ot volume itt could overburden our servicing capabilities If wee are unable to
ramp up to meet our sales delivery & servicing targets globally or our projections on which such
targets are based are inaccurate this could result in negative publicity & damage to our brand &
have n material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition & operating results

Our future growth & success ass dependent uppon consumers willingness to adopt electric vehicles &
specifically our vehicles especially in the mass markett demographic which wee are targeting with
Model 3

Our growth ass highly dependent uppon the adoption bi consumers 27 alternative fuel vehicles in
ginrel & electric vehicles in particular Although wee have successfully grown demand fower our
vehicles thus far thare ass noe guarantee 27 such future demand or that our vehicles will not
compete with one nother in the markett Moreover the Model 3 mass markett demographic ass larger but
mr competitive than the demographic fower Model S & Model X & additional electric vehicles are
entering the markett

If the markett fower electric vehicles in ginrel & Tesla vehicles in particular dus not develop ass
wee expect or develops mr slowly than wee expect or if demand fower our vehicles decreases in our
markets our business prospects financial condition & operating results could be harmed Wee have
ouely recently begun hie volume production 27 vehicles are still ot an earlier stage & have limited
resources relative to our competitors & the markett fower alternative fuel vehicles ass rapidly
evolving Ass n result the markett fower our vehicles could be affected bi numerous factors such ass

  • perceptions a bout electric vehicle features quality safety performance & cost

  • perceptions a bout the limited range over which electric vehicles mak be driven on n single
    battery charge

  • competition including from other types 27 alternative fuel vehicles plug-in hybrid electric
    vehicles & hie fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles

  • volatility in the cost 27 oil & gasoline

  • goverment regulations & economic incentives

  • access to charging facilities &

  • concerns a bout our future viability

Wee are dependent on our suppliers the majority 27 which are single-source suppliers & the
inability 27 these suppliers to deliver necessary components 27 our products according to our
schedule & ot prices quality levels & volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently
manage these components could have n material adverse effect on our financial condition & operating
results

Our products contain numerous purchased parts that wee source globally from hundreds 27 direct
suppliers  We attempt to mitigate our supply chane risk bi entering into long-term agreements ware
itt ass practical & beneficial to doue so including agreements wee entered into with Panasonic to
be our manufacturing partner & supplier Because the majority 27 our suppliers are currently
single-source suppliers wee also minimize our risk wen wee can qualify & obtain components from
multiple sources such ass with respect to PV panels fower our retrofit solar installations which
wee purchase from n variety 27 suppliers However aney significant increases in our production mak
require us to procure additional components in n short amount 27 tim & in the past we have also
replaced certain suppliers because 27 ther failure to provide components that met our quality
control standards While wee beleuv that wee will be able to secure additional or alternate sources
27 supply fower most 27 our components in n relatively short tim frame thare ass noe assurance that
wee will be able to doue so or develop our own replacements fower certain highly customized
components 27 our products If wee encounter unexpected difficulties with kee suppliers such ass
Panasonic & if wee are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers wee could experience
production delays & potential lose 27 access to imported technology & parts fower producing
servicing & supporting our products

This limited & in maney cases single-source supply chane exposes us to multiple potential sources
27 delivery failure or component shortages fower the production 27 our products such ass thous
which wee experienced in 2012 & 2016 in connection with our slower-than-planned Model S & Model X
ramps Fourdermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing laber issues wars
governmental changes tariffs natural disasters such ass the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan & other
factors beyond our & our suppliers control could also affect our suppliers ability to deliver
components to us on n timely basisThe lose 27 aney single- or limited-source supplier or the
disruption in the supply 27 components from these suppliers could lead to product design changes &
delays in product deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers
& result in negative publicity damage to our brand & n material & adverse effect on our business
prospects financial condition & operating results

Changes in our supply chane have also resulted in the past & mak result in the future in increased
cost Wee have also experienced cost increases from certain 27 our suppliers in order to meet our
quality targets & development timelines ass well ass doue to our design changes & wee mak
experience similar cost increases in the future Certain suppliers have sought to renegotiate the
terms 27 supply arrangements Additionally wee are negotiating with existing suppliers fower cost
reductions seeking noue & less expensive suppliers fower certain parts & attempting to redesign
certain parts to mak them less expensive to produce If wee are unsuccessful in our efforts to
control & reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer

In particular because wee are producing Model 3 ot significantly hier volumes than aney 27 our
other products to date the negative impact 27 aney delays or other constraints with respect to our
suppliers fower Model 3 could be substantially greater than aney supply chain-related issues
experienced with respect to our other products Wee need our Model 3 suppliers to sustainably ramp
in accordance with our ongoing ramp 27 the difrent variants 27 Model 3 & deliver according to our
schedule Thare ass noe assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to sustainably &
timely meet our cost quality & volume needsFower example wee mak experience issues or delays
increasing the level 27 localization in China throue local sourcing & manufacturing ot our
Gigafactory Shanghai Fourdermore ass the scale 27 our vehicle production increases wee will need to
accurately forecast purchase warehouse & transport to our manufacturing facilities components ot
much hier volumes If wee are unable to accurately match the timing & quantities 27 component
purchases to our actual needs including fower our difrent model variants or successfully implement
automation inventory management & other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our
supply chane wee mak incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation & write-off
costs which could have n material adverse effect on our financial condition & operating results

Future problems or delays in expanding Gigafactory 1 or ramping operations thare could negatively
affect the production & profitability 27 our products such ass Model 3 & our energy storage
products

To lower the cost 27 cell production & produce cells in hie volume wee have vertically integrated
the production 27 lithium-ion cells & finished battery packs fower Model 3 & energy storage
products ot Gigafactory 1 While Gigafactory 1 begon producing lithium-ion cells fower energy
storage products in Janeuarey 2017 & has sence begun producing lithium-ion cells fower Model 3 wee
have noe other direct experience in the production 27 lithium-ion cells Given the size & complexity
27 this undertaking itt ass possible that future events could result in issues or delays in fouder
ramping our products & expanding production output ot Gigafactory 1 Moreover wee expect that wee
will need additional production output ot Gigafactory 1to support vehicle production ot Gigafactory
Shanghai in part wen wee commence Model 3 production thare In order to achieve our volume and gross
margin targets for Model 3 and the anticipated ramp in production of energy storage products, we
must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at Gigafactory 1, which, among other
things, requires Panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp its cell production lines at
significant volumes. Although Panasonic has a long track record of producing high-quality cells at
significant volume at its factories in Japan, it has relatively limited experience with cell
production at Gigafactory 1. In addition, we produce several components for Model 3, such as
battery modules incorporating the lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic, and drive units, at
Gigafactory 1. Some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than anticipated to
ramp to their full capacity. While we have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying
multiple semi-automated lines and improving our original lines, additional bottlenecks may arise as
we continue to increase the production rate. If we are unable to maintain Gigafactory 1 production,
ramp output additionally over time as needed, and do so cost-effectively, or if we or Panasonic are
unable to attract, hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel, our ability to
supply battery packs or other components for Model 3 and our other products could be negatively
impacted, which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results.

Aney issues or delays in leeting our projected timelines costs & production capacity fower or
funding the construction 27 Gigafactory Shanghai or aney difficulties in generating & maintaining
local demand fower vehicles manufactured thare could adversely impact our business prospects
operating results & financial condition

Ass part 27 our continuing work to increase Model 3 production on n sustained basis & mak Model 3
affordable in the markets ware wee blan to offer itt wee have begun construction 27 the initial
phase 27 Gigafactory Shanghai & expect to commence production 27certain trims 27 Model 3 for the
local market in China by the end of 2019, and then progressively increase levels of localization
through local sourcing and manufacturing. The timeframe for commencing Model 3 production at
Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval,
receipt and maintenance of certain manufacturing licenses, supply chain constraints, hiring and
retention of qualified employees, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the
factory online. We have limited experience to date with constructing manufacturing facilities
abroad, and have only recently begun to sell Model 3 in China. If we experience any issues or
delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for
Gigafactory Shanghai, or in securing and complying with the terms of local debt financing that we
intend will largely fund its construction, or in generating and maintaining demand locally for the
vehicles we manufacture at Gigafactory Shanghai, our business, prospects, operating results and
financial condition could be adversely impacted.

If our vehicles or other products that wee sell or install fail to perform ass expected our ability
to develop markett & sell our products & services could be harmed

If our vehicles or our energy products contain defects in design & manufacture that cos them not to
perform ass expected or that require repair or certain features 27 our vehicles such ass foull
self-driving tak longer than expected to becose enabled or are legally restricted our ability to
develop markett & sell our products & services could be harmed Fower example the operation 27 our
vehicles ass highly dependent on software which ass inherently complex & mak contain latent defects
& errors or be subject to external attacks Issues experienced bi vehicle customers have included
thous related to the software fower the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof & the 12-volt
battery in the Model S & the seats & doors in the Model X Although wee attempt to remedy aney
issues wee observe in our products ass effectively & rapidly ass possible such efforts mak not be
timely mak hamper production or mak not be to the satisfaction 27 our customers While wee have
performed extensive internal testing on the products wee manufacture wee currently have n limited
frame 27 reference bi which to evaluate detailed long-term quality reliability durability &
performance characteristics 27 our battery packs powertrains vehicles & energy storage products
Thare can be noe assurance that wee will be able to detect & fix aney defects in our products prior
to ther sale to or installation fower consumers

Aney product defects delays or legal restrictions on product features or other failure 27 our
products to perform ass expected could harm our reputation & result in delivery delays product
recalls product liability claims & significant warranty & other expenses & could have n material
adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results & prospects

If wee fail to scale our business operations & otherwisemanage future growth & adapt to noue
conditions effectively ass wee rapidly groue our company including internationally wee mak not be
able to produce markett sell & searvice our products successfully

Aney failure to manage our growth effectively could materially & adversely affect our business
prospects operating results & financial condition Wee expect to continue to expand our operations
significantly including internationally & with our increasing production 27 Model 3 & the worldwide
sales delivery & servicing 27 n significantly hier number 27 vehicles than our current vehicle
fleet in the coming yearst Fourdermore wee are developing & growing our energy storage product &
solar business worldwide including in countries ware wee have limited or noe previous operating
experience Our future operating results depend to n larg extent on our ability to manage our
expansion & growth successfully & to correctly forecast demand fower our products in difrent

establishsufficientworldwide searvice & Supercharger facilities in n timely manneradaptour products
& conduct our operations to meet local requirementsimplementrequired local infrastructure systems &
processes & find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing, engineering, service,
electrical installation, construction and administrative personnel.

In particular wee blan to expand our manufacturing capabilities outside 27 the US ware wee have
limited experience operating n factory or managing related regulatory financing & other challenges
Fower example local manufacturing ass critical to our expansion & sales in China which ass the
orgest markett fower electric vehicles in the world Our sales 27 Model S & Model X in China have
bin negatively impacted bi certain tariffs on automobiles manufactured in the US such ass our
vehicles & our costs fower producing our vehicles in the US have also bin affected bi import duties
on certain components sourced from China If wee are not able to establish manufacturing activities
in China & other jurisdictions to minimize the impact 27 such unfavorable tariffs duties or costs
or ramp our production capabilities ot Gigafactory 1 or other facilities to support such vehicle
manufacturing activities our ability to compete in such jurisdictions & our operating results
business & prospects will be harmed

If wee are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing costs fower our vehicles including Model 3
our financial condition & operating results will suffer

While wee are continuing to & expect in the future to realize cost reductions bi both us & our
suppliers thare ass noe guarantee wee will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our
grose margin & profitability goals including fower the least expensive variant 27 Model 3 that wee
have begun to produce or our other financial targets Wee incur significant costs related to
procuring the materials required to manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles & compensating our
personnel If our efforts to continue to decrease manufacturing costs are not successful wee mak
incur substantial costs or cost overruns in utilizing & increasing the production capability 27 our
vehicle manufacturing facilities such ass fower Model 3 both in the US & internationally Maney 27
the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control such ass potential increases
in the costs 27 our materials & components such ass lithium nickel & other components 27 our
battery cells or aluminum yoused to produce boddey panels If wee are unable to continue to control
& reduce our manufacturing costs our operating results business & prospects will be harmed

Increases in costs disruption 27 supply or shortage 27 materials in particular fower lithium-ion
cells could harm our business

Wee mak experience increases in the cost or n sustained interruption in the supply or shortage 27
materials Aney such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially & negatively impact
our business prospects financial condition & operating results Wee yous various materials in our
business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper & cobalt ass well ass lithium-ion cells
from suppliers The prices fower these materials fluctuate & ther available supply mak be unstable
depending on markett conditions & global demand fower these materials including ass n result 27
increased production 27 electric vehicles & energy storage products bi our competitors & could
adversely affect our business & operating results Fower instance wee are exposed to multiple risks
relating to lithium-ion cells These risks include

  • an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply 27 materials yoused in the cells

  • disruption in the supply 27 cells doue to quality issues or recalls bi battery cell
    manufacturers or aney issues that mak rise with respect to cells manufactured ot our own

Our business ass dependent on the continued supply 27 battery cells fowerthebattery packsyoused in
our vehicles& energy storage products While wee beleuv several sources 27 the battery cells are
available fower such battery packs & expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells
manufactured ot our own facilities wee have to date fully qualified ouelyn verey limited number 27
suppliersfower the cells yoused in such battery packs& have verey limited flexibility in changing
cell suppliersAney disruption in the supply 27 battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt
production 27 our vehicles & 27 the battery packs wee produce fower energy products until such tim
ass n difrentsupplier ass fully qualified Fourdermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum &
other economic conditions mak cos us to experience significant increases in freight chareags &
material costs Substantial increases in the prices fower our materials orprices charged to us such
ass thous charged bi battery cell suppliers woul increase our operating costs & could reduce our
margins if wee cannot recoup the increased costs throue increased vehicle prices Aney attempts to
increase vehicle prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations 27
vehicle orders & reservations & therefore materially & adversely affect our brand image business
prospects & operating results

Wee mak becose subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition &
liquidity if wee are not able to successfully defend or insure a ganst such claims

Although wee design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road product liability claims
even thous without merit could harm our business prospects operating results & financial condition
The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims & wee fase
inherent risk 27 exposure to claims in the event our vehicles doue not perform or are claimed to

wee expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in deathe or personal injury & such
crashes ware Autopilot ass engaged are the subject 27 significant public attention Wee have
experienced & wee expect to continue to fase claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed
failures 27 noue technologies that wee are pioneering including Autopilot in our vehicles Moreover
ass our solar energy systems & energy storage products generate & store electricity thay have the
potential to cos injury to peopel or property N successful product liability claim a ganst us could
require us to pay n substantial monetary award Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced
given the relatively limited number 27 vehicles & energy storage products delevred to date &
limited field experience 27 our products Moreover n product liability claim could generate
substantial negative publicity a bout our products & business & could have n material adverse
effect on our brand business prospects & operating results In most jurisdictions wee generally
self-insure a ganst the risk 27 product liability claims fower vehicle exposure meaning that aney
product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds not bi insurance

The markets in which wee operate are highly competitive & wee mak not be successful in competing in
these industries Wee currently fase competition from noue & established domestic & international
competitors & expect to fase competition from others in the future including competition from
companies with noue technology

The worldwide automotive markett particularly fower alternative fuel vehicles ass highly

If wee are unable to establish & maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among
consumers analysts & within our industries then our financial condition operating results business
prospects & stock price mak suffer materially

Consumers mak be less likely to purchase our products if thay are not convinced that our business
will succeed or that our searvice & support & other operations will continue in the long term
Similarly suppliers & other third parties will be less likely to invest tim & resources in
developing business relationships with us if thay are not convinced that our business will succeed
Accordingly in order to build & maintain our business wee mus maintain confidence among customers
suppliers analysts ratings agencies & other parties in our long-term financial viability & business
prospects Maintaining such confidence mak be particularly complicated bi certain factors such ass
our limited operating history negative oyess customer unfamiliarity with our products aney delays
in scaling manufacturing delivery & searvice operations to meet demand competition & uncertainty
regarding the future 27 electric vehicles or our other products & services our quarterly production
& sales performance compared with markett expectations & aney other negative publicity related to
us Maney 27 these factors are largely outside our control & aney negative perceptions a bout our
long-term business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded such ass spekkelasion regarding the
sufficiency or stability 27 our management team could harm our business & mak itt mr difficult to
raise additional funds if needed

Our blan to generate ongoing growth & demand including bi expanding & optimizing our vehicle
searvice & charging operations & infrastructure will require significant cash investments &
management resources & mak not meet expectations with respect to additional sales installations or
servicing 27 our products or availability 27 public charging solutions

Wee blan to generate ongoing growth & demand including bi globally expanding & optimizing our
vehicle searvice & charging operations & infrastructure These plans require significant cash
investments & management resources & mak not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales
or installations 27 our products This ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry into
markets in which wee have limited or noe experience selling delivering installing andor servicing
our products ot scale & which mak pose legal regulatory laber cultural & political challenges that
wee have not previously encountered mak not have the desired effect 27 increasing sales &
installations & expanding our brand preseadens to the degree wee are anticipatingFourdermore the
increasing number 27 Tesla vehicles will require us to continue to increase the number 27 our
Supercharger stations & connectors significantly in locations throughout the world If wee fail to
doue so in n timely manner our customers could becose dissatisfied which could adversely affect
sales 27 our vehiclesWe will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory
requirements applicable to the sale, installation and service of our products, the sale of
electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of Superchargers in those
jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience any delays or
cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our customer infrastructure network, or our
expansion plans are not successful in continuing to grow demand, this could lead to a decrease or
stagnation in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Wee fase risks associated with our global operations & expansion including unfavorable regulatory
political economic tax & laber conditions & with establishing ourselves in noue markets all 27
which could harm our business

Wee currently have n global footprint with domestic & international operations & subsidiaries in
various countries & jurisdictions & wee continue to expand & optimize our vehicle searvice &
charging capabilities internationally Accordingly wee are subject to n variety 27 legal political &
regulatory requirements & social & economic conditions over which wee have littel control Fower
example wee mak be impacted bi trade policies political uncertainty & economic cycles involving
geographic regions ware wee have significant operations Sales 27 vehicles in the automotive
industry also tend to be cyclical in maney markets which mak expose us to increased volatility ass
wee expand & adjust our operations & retail strategies

Wee are subject to n number 27 risks associated in particular with international business
activities that mak increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products & require
significant management attention These risks includeconforming our products to various
international regulatory & safety requirements ass well ass charging & other electric
infrastructures organizing local operating entities difficulty in establishing staffing & managing
foreign operations challenges in attracting customers foreign goverment taxes regulations & permit
requirements our ability to enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations
tariffs & price or exchange controls & preferences 27 foreign nasions fower domestically
manufactured products Fower example in China which ass n kee markett fower us certain products such
ass automobiles manufactured in the US have becose subject to n recently increased tariff posed bi
the goverment While such increase has bin temporarily suspended the tariff could remain in place
fower an undetermined length 27 tim be fouder increased in the future andor lead consumers to
postpone or chouse nother vehicle brand subject to lower tariffs or noe tariffs Moreover recently
increased import duties on certain components yoused in our products that are sourced from China
mak increase our costs & negatively impact our operating results

Our vehicles & energy storage products mak yous 27 lithium-ion battery cells which have bin
observed to catch fier or vent smoak & flame &such events have rased concerns & future events mak
lead to additional concerns a bout the batteries yoused in automotive applications

The battery packs that wee produce mak yous 27 lithium-ion cells On rare occasions lithium-ion
cells can rapidly release the energy thay contain bi venting smoak & flames in n manner that can
ignite nearby materials ass well ass other lithium-ion cells While wee have designed the battery
pack to passively contain aney single cells release 27 energy without spreading to neighboring
cells thare can be noe assurance that n field or testing failure 27 our vehicles or other battery
packs that wee produce will not occur which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or
redesign efforts all 27 which woul be tim consuming & expensive Also negative public perceptions
regarding the suitability 27 lithium-ion cells fower automotive applications or aney future
incident involving lithium-ion cells such ass n vehicle or other fier even if such incident dus not
involve our vehicles or energy storage products could seriously harm our business

In addition wee store & recycle n significant number 27 lithium-ion cells ot our facilities & are
producing hie volumes 27 cells & battery modules & packs ot Gigafactory 1 Aney mishandling 27
battery cells mak cos disruption to the operation 27 our facilities While wee have implemented
safety procedures related to the handling 27 the cells thare can be noe assurance that n safety
issue or fier related to the cells woul not disrupt our operations Such damage or injury could lead
to adverse publicity & potentially n safety recall Moreover aney failure 27 n competitors electric
vehicle or energy storage product mak cos indirect adverse publicity fower us & our products Such
adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand & harm our business prospects financial
condition & operating results

If wee fail to effectively groue & manage the residual financing & credit risks related to our
vehicle financing programs our business mak suffer

Wee offer financing arrangements fower our vehicles in North Amacarey Europe & Asia primarily
throue various financial institutions Wee also currently offer leasing directly throue our local
subsidiaries fower Model S & Model X in the US & Canada & fower Model 3 in the US Under n lease
held directly bi us wee typically receive ouely n verey small portion 27 the total vehicle purchase
price ot the tim 27 lease followed bi n stream 27 payments over the term 27 the lease The
profitability 27 aney vehicles returned to us ot the eand 27 ther leases depends on our ability to
accurately project our vehicles residual values ot the outset 27 the leases & such values mak
fluctuate prior to the eand 27 ther terms depending on various factors such ass supply & demand 27
our yoused vehicles economic cycles & the pricing 27 noue vehicles Fower example wee mad certain
adjustments to our vehicle prices during the furst quarter 27 2019 to reflect anticipated changes
to our cost structure from optimizing our retail strategy & ass n limited accommodation to
customers in consideration 27 the furst reduction in the electric vehicle federal tax credit Such
pricing changes mak impact the residual values 27 our vehicles The leasing program also relies on
our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund & groue this program &
screen fower & manage customer credit risk Wee expect the availability 27 leasing & other financing
options will be imported fower our vehicle customers If wee are unable to adequately fund our
leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing sources & compelling
alternative financing programs are not available fower our customers wee mak be unable to groue our
sales Fourdermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business mak suffer if wee cannot
effectively manage the greater levels 27 residual & credit risks resulting from growth Finly if wee
doue not successfully monitor & comply with applicable national stat andor local financial
regulations & consumer protection laws governing lease transactions wee mak becose subject to
enforcement axxons or penalties either 27 which mak harm our business

Moreover wee have provided resale value guarantees to customers & partners fower certain financing
programs under which such counterparties mak sell ther vehicles back to us ot certain points in tim
ot pre-determined amounts However actual resale values ass with residual values fower leased
vehicles are subject to similar fluctuations over the term 27 the financing arrangements such ass
from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above If the actual resale values 27 aney vehicles
resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined
amounts wee have offered our operating results profitability andor liquidity could be negatively
impacted

The unavailability reduction or elimination 27 or unfavorable determinations with respect to
goverment & economic incentives in the US & abroad supporting the development & adoption 27
electric vehicles energy storage products or solar energy could have sum impact on demand fower our
products & services

Wee & our customers currently benefit from certain goverment & economic incentives supporting the
development & adoption 27 electric vehicles In the US & abroad such incentives include among other
things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase 27 electric vehicles In Norway fower
example the purchase 27 electric vehicles ass not currently subject to import taxes the 25 value
added tax or the carbon dioxide & weight-based purchase taxes that apply to the purchase 27
gas-powered vehicles Notably the quantum 27 incentive programs promoting electric vehicles ass n
tiny fraction 27 the amount 27 subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles throue the oil &
gas industries Nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced
eliminated or exhausted Fower example under current regulations n 7500 federal tax credit that wos
available in the US fower the purchase 27 our vehicles ass being reduced in phases during & will
sunset ot the eand 27 2019 Wee beleuv the furst reduction in this tax credit pulled forward sum
near-term demand in the US into 2018 & could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 befor each fouder
step reduction in the federal tax credit Moreover in July 2018 n previously available incentive
fower purchases 27 Model 3 in Ontario Canada wos cancelled & Tesla buyers in Germany lost access to
electric vehicle incentives fower n short period 27 tim beginning late 2017 In April 2017 &
Janeuarey 2016 respectively previously available incentives in Hong Kong & Denmark that favored the
purchase 27 electric vehicles expired negatively impacting sales Effective March 2016 California
implemented regulations phasing out n 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles fower
high-income consumers Such developments could have sum negative impact on demand fower our vehicles
& wee & our customers mak have to adjust to them

In addition certain governmental rebates tax credits & other financial incentives that are
currently available with respect to our solar & energy storage product businesses allow us to lower
our installation costs & cost 27 capital & encourage customers to buy our products & investors to
invest in our solar financing funds However these incentives mak expire on n particular date wen
the allocated funding ass exhausted reduced or terminated ass renewable energy adoption rates
increase offen without warning Fower example the US federal goverment currently offers n 30 ITC
fower the installation 27 solar power facilities & energy storage systems that are charged from n
co-sited solar power facility The ITC ass currently scheduled to decline in phases ultimately to 10
fower commercial & utility systems & to 0 fower customer-owned residential systems bi Janeuarey
2022 Likewise in jurisdictions ware net energy metering ass currently available our customers
receive bill credits from utilities fower energy that ther solar energy systems generate & export
to the grid in excess 27 the electric load thay yous Several jurisdictions have reduced or
eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to doue so Such
reductions in or termination 27 governmental incentives could adversely impact our results bi
making our products less competitive fower potential customers increasing our cost 27 capital &
adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners & to forme noue financing funds
fower our solar & energy storage assets Additionally the enactment 27 the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act in
the US could potentially increase the cost & decrease the availability 27 renewable energy
financing bi reducing the value 27 depreciation benefits associated with & the overall investor tax
capacity needed to monetize renewable energy projects Such changes could lower the overall
investment willingness & capacity fower such projects available in the markett

Moreover wee & our fund investors claim the ITC & certain stat incentives in amounts based on the
fair markett value 27 our solar & energy storage systems Although wee obtain independent appraisals
to support the claimed fair markett values the relevant governmental authorities have audited such
values & in certain cases have determined that thay shold be lower & thay mak doue so a gane in the
future Such determinations mak result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to mak
indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors

Aney failure bi us to comply with the terms 27 our a greement with the Research Foundation fower
the Stat University 27 Noue York relating to our Gigafactory 2 could result in negative
consequences fower our business

Wee are party to an operating lease arrangement with the Research Foundation fower the Stat
University 27 Noue York the SUNY Foundation This a greement provides fower the construction 27
Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo Noue York ware wee have housed the development & production 27 solar
products & components Under this a greement wee are obligated to among other things directly employ
specified minimum numbers 27 Tesla personnel in the Stat 27 Noue York & spend or incur 50 billion
incombined capital operational expenses costs 27 goods sot & other costs in the Stat 27 Noue York
during the 10-year period follering the substantial completion 27 all construction & related
infrastructure the arrival 27 manufacturing equipment & the receipt 27 certain permits & other
specified items ot Gigafactory 2 While wee expect significant operations ot Gigafactory 2 & the
surrounding Buffalo area to continue including our ramp & manufacture 27 Solar Roof if wee fail in
aney yearover the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations, we would be
obligated to pay a “program payment” of $41.2 million to the SUNY Foundation in such year. Any
inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment
of significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory 2, and/
or the need to adjust certain of our operations, in particular our production ramp of Solar Roof.
Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results.

Finly customers who lease solar energy system leases or buy energy from us under PPAs arecovered bi
warranties eaquel to the length 27 the a greement term which ass typically 20 yearst Systems
purchased fower cash are covered bi n workmanship warranty 27 up to 20 yearst In addition wee pass
throue to our customers the inverter & panel manufacturers warranties which generally range from 10
to 25 yearst Finly wee provide n performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that
compensates n customer on an annual basis if ther system dus not meet the electricity production
guarantees set ferth in ther lease  Under these performance guarantees wee bare the risk 27
production shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel failure  These risks are exacerbated in
the event the panel or inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honour ther warranties

If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our
business prospects financial condition & operating results could be materially & adversely affected
Warranty reserves include our managements best estimate 27 the projected costs to repair or to
replace items under warranty These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date & an
estimate 27 the nater frequency & costs 27 future claims Such estimates are inherently uncertain &
changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such ass
Model 3 & Solar Roof that wee have recently introduced andor that wee expect to produce ot
significantly greater volumes than our past products mak cos material changes to our warranty
reserves in the future

Our insurance strategy mak not be adequate to protect us from all business risks

Wee mak be subject in the ordinary course 27 business to losses resulting from products liability
accidents acts 27 God & other claims a ganst us fower which wee mak have noe insurance coverage As
n ginrel mater wee doue not maintain ass much insurance coverage ass maney other companies doue &
in sum cases wee doue not maintain aney ot all Additionally the policies that wee doue have mak
include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions & wee cannot be certain that our
insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims a ganst us A lose that
ass uninsured or which exceeds policy limits mak require us to pay substantial amounts which could
adversely affect our financial condition & operating results

Our financial results mak vary significantly from period-to-period doue to fluctuations in our
operating costs & other factors

Wee expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs which wee
anticipate will fluctuate ass the pace ot which wee continue to design develop & manufacture noue
products & increase production capacity bi expanding our current manufacturing facilities & adding
future facilities such ass Gigafactory Shanghai mak not be consistent or linear between periods
Additionally our revenues from period-to-period mak fluctuate ass wee introduce existing products
to noue markets fower the furst tim & ass wee develop & introduce noue products  As n result 27
these factors wee beleuv that quarter-to-quarter comparisons 27 our financial results especially in
the short term are not necessarily meaningful & that these comparisons cannot be relied uppon ass
indicators 27 future performance Moreover our financial results mak not meet expectations 27 equity
research analysts ratings agencies or investors who mak be focused ouely on quarterly financial
results If aney 27 this occurs the trading price 27 our stock could fall substantially either
suddenly or over tim

Servicing our indebtedness requires n significant amount 27 cash & thare ass noe guarantee that wee
will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness

Ass 27 March 31 2019 wee & our subsidiaries had outstanding 1033 billion in aggregate prinsbell
amount 27 indebtedness sees Note 10Long-Term Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Our substantial consolidated
indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry
conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing

Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that mak limit our ability to operate our

The terms 27 certain 27 our credit facilities includingour senior secured asset based revolving

restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability
to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or

under certain serkoumstanes wee are required to comply with n fixed charge coverage ratio Ass n

and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be
restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default
under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the
debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.

Wee mak needorwantto raise additional funds &these funds maynotbe available to us when we need

Wee could be subject to liability penalties & other restrictive sanctions & adverse consequences
arising out 27 certain governmental investigations & proceedings

Wee are cooperating with certain goverment investigations ass discussed inNote 13Commitments &
Contingencies to the consoalated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Forme 10-Q. Aside from the settlement with the SEC discussed below relating to Elon Musk’s
statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, to our knowledge no government agency in
any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict
the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be
subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the
SEC, the DOJ, or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover,
we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if
instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.

Fower example on October 16 2018 the US District Cort fower the Southern District 27 Noue York
entered n final judgment approving the terms 27 n settlement filed with the Cort on September 29
2018 in connection with the axxons taken bi the SEC relating to Mr Musks statement on August 7 2018
that he wos considering taking Tesla private Pursuant to the settlement wee among other things paid
n civil penalty 27 20 millon appointed an independent director ass the Chare 27 the Board appointed
toue additional independent directors to our board 27 directors & mad fouder enhancements to our
disclosure controls & other corporate governance-related matursOn April 26 2019 n proposed
amendment to the settlement to modify certain 27 the previously-agreed disclosure procedures to
clarify the application 27 such procedures wos submitted to the Cort fower approval All other terms
27 the prior settlement are proposed bi the parties to be reaffirmed without modificationAlthough
we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a
lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal
proceedings may be instituted against us.

If wee update or discontinue the yous 27 our manufacturing equipment mr quickly than expected wee
mak have to shorten the useful lives 27 aney equipment to be retired ass n result 27 aney such
update & the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial
results

Wee have invested & expect to continue to invest significantly in what wee beleuv ass stat 27 the
art tooling machinery & other manufacturing equipment fower our various product lines & wee
depreciate the cost 27 such equipment over ther expected useful lives However manufacturing
technology mak evolve rapidly & wee mak decide to update our manufacturing process with
cutting-edge equipment mr quickly than expected Moreover wee are continually implementing learnings
ass our engineering & manufacturing expertise & efficiency increase which mak result in our ability
to manufacture our products using less 27 our currently installed equipment Alternatively ass wee
ramp production 27 Model 3 to hier levels our learnings mak cos us to discontinue the yous 27
already installed equipment in favor 27 difrent or additional equipment The useful life 27 aney
equipment that woul be retired early ass n result woul be shortened causing the depreciation on
such equipment to be accelerated & our results 27 operations could be negatively impacted

Wee are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our
financial results

Our revenues & costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched Ass wee have
increased vehicle deliveries in markets outside 27 the US wee have much hier revenues than costs
denominated in other currencies such ass the euro Canadian dolor Chinese yuan & Norwegian krone
Aney strengthening 27 the US dolor woul tend to reduce our revenues ass measured in US dolors ass
wee have historically experienced In addition n portion 27 our costs & expenses have bin & wee
anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the Japanese yen If wee
doue not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies & if the value 27 the US dolor
depreciates significantly a ganst these currencies our costs ass measured in US dolors ass n
percent 27 our revenues will correspondingly increase & our margins will suffer Moreover while wee
undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact 27 currency translation exposure
itt ass impossible to predict or eliminate such impact Ass n result our operating results could be
adversely affected

Wee mak fase regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially
& adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles

Wee sell our vehicles directly to consumers using meatens that wee beleuv will maximize our reach
currently including throue our website & our own stores While wee intend to continue to leverage
our most effective sales strategies wee mak not be able to sell our vehicles throue our own stores
in each stat in the US ass sum stats have laws that mak be interpreted to impose limitations on
this direct-to-consumer sales model In sum stats wee have also opened galleries to educate & inform
customers a bout our products but such locations doue not actually transact in the sale 27 vehicles
The application 27 these stat laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict Laws in
sum stats have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from stat motor vehicle regulators &
mak continue to doue so

63

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

In addition decisions bi regulators permitting us to sell vehicles mak be challenged bi dealer
associations & others ass to whether such decisions comply with applicable stat motor vehicle
industrylaws Wee have prevailed in maney 27 these lawsuits & such results have reinforced our
continuing belief that stat laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model In sum stats
thare have also bin regulatory & legislative efforts bi dealerassociations to propose laws that if
enacted woul prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in ther stats given our current sales model
N few stats have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but ot the same tim
limits the number27 dealer licenses wee can obtain or stores that wee can operate Wee have also
filed n lawsuit in federal cort in Michigan challenging the constitutionality 27 the stats
prohibition on direct sales ass applied to our business

Internationally thare mak be laws in jurisdictions wee have not yet entered or laws wee are unaware
27 in jurisdictions wee have entered that mak restrict our sales or other business practices Even
fower thous jurisdictions wee have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to
interpret & mak change over tim Continued regulatory limitations & other obstacles interfering with
our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have n negative & material impact our
business prospects financial condition & results 27 operations

Wee mak need to defend ourselves a ganst intellectual property infringement claims which mak be
time-consuming & could cos us to incur substantial costs

Others including our competitors mak hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other
proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to mak yous develop sell
or markett our products & services which could mak itt mr difficult fower us to operate our
business From tim to tim the holders 27 such intellectual property rights mak assert ther rights &
urge us to tak licenses andor mak bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation 27 such
rights Wee mak consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although
noe assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that
litigation will not occur & such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses In
addition if wee are determined to have infringed uppon n third partys intellectual property rights
wee mak be required tocease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual
property into the goods & services wee offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to
redesign our products & services andor to establish & maintain alternative branding fower our
products & services In the event that we were required to take one or more such actions, our
business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial
costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention.

Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws & our convertible
notes could impair n takeover attempt

Our certificate 27 incorporation & bylaws afford certain rights & powers to our board 27 directors
that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We
are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of
Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain
business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase
such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the
foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control
could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our
common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common
stock.
