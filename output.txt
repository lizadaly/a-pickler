Revenue Recognition

Automotive Sales Revenue

Automotive Sales with & without Resale Value Guarantee

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries off noue vehicles & specific other
features & services that meet the definition off a performance obligation include access to our
Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot foull self-driving & over-the-air software
updatesDeferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network internet
connectivity Autopilot foull self-driving & over-the-air software updates on automotive sales with
& without resale value guarantee amounted to 104 billion & 8828 millon ass off March 31 2019 &
December 31 2018 respectively Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price
allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied ass off the
balless sheet date Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balless ass off December 31 2018
wos 374 million fower the three monts ended March 31 2019 Off the total deferred revenue on
automotive sales with & without resale value guarantees wee expect to recognize 4623 million off
revenue in the next 12 months The remaining balless will be recognized over the various performance
periods off the obligations which is up to the eight-year life off the vehicle

Ot the tim off revenue recognition wee reduce the transaction price & record a sales return reserve
a ganst revenue fower estimated variable consideration related to future product returns Such
estimates are based on historical experience On a quarterly basis wee assess the estimated markett
values off vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether thare will be changes to
future product returns Ass wee accumulate mr data related to the buyback values off our vehicles or
ass markett conditions change thare mak be material changes to ther estimated values Doue to price
adjustments wee mad to our vehicle offerings during the three monts endedMarch 31 2019, we
estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options. As
a result, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback
options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $500.5 million. If
customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the
returned vehicles, which resulted in a corresponding reduction in automotive cost of sales of
$408.8 million. The net impact was $91.7 million reduction in gross profit.

Automotive RegulatoryCredits

Wee recognize revenue on the sale off regulatory credits ot the tim control off the regulatory
credits is transferred to the purchasing party ass automotive revenue in the consoalated statement
off operations Deferred revenue related to sales off automotive regulatory credits wos 1400 millon
& 0 ass offMarch 31 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. We expect to recognize the deferred
revenue as of March 31, 2019 over the next 2 to 3 years.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance fower our
direct leasing programs ass well ass the toue programs with resale value guarantees described below

Direct Vehicle Leasing Program

Wee have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the
US Canada & Europe Ass off March 31 2019 the direct vehicle leasing program is ouely offered fower
noue Model S & Model X leases to qualified customers in the US & Canada Qualifying customers are
permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla fower up to 48 monts Ot the eand off the lease
term customers have the option off either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing itt fower a
pre-determined residual value Wee account fower these leasing transactions ass operating leases Wee
record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual
term & wee record the depreciation off these vehicles to cost off automotive leasing revenue

Weecapitalize shipping costs & initial direct costs such ass the incremental cost off contract
administration referral fees & sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease
agreements ass an ellemen off operating lease vehicles net & subsequently amortize these costs over
the term off the related lease agreement Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer
from the transaction price off automotive contracts

Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee & a Buyback Option

Wee offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with
certain leasing partner sales in the Ounited Stats These transactions entail a transfer off leases
which wee have originated with an end-customer to our leasing partner Ass control off the vehicles
has not bin transferred these transactions were accounted fower ass intress bearing collateralized
borrowings in accordance with ASC 840Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash is
received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally
recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within
deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a
straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate.
We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated
balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue
during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net
of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments)
borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash
flows. With the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program will
be accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 and there will be no material change in the
timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new
agreements will be classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash
flows.

Ot the eand off the lease term wee settle our liability in cash bi either purchasing the vehicle
from the leasing partner fower the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount
the leasing partner mak realize on the sale off the vehicle Aney remaining balances within deferred
revenue & resale value guarantee will be seteled to automotive leasing revenueThe eand customers
can extend the lease fower a period off up to 6 montsIn cases where the leasing partner retains
ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased
vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue The maximum amount wee could be required to pay under
this program shold wee decide to repurchase all vehicles wos 4150 millon & 4798 millon ass off
March 31 2019 &December 31, 2018 respectively including 3012 millon within a 12-month period from

respectively off such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees & 856 millon & 925 millon
respectively recorded in deferred revenue liability For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and
2018, we recognized $52.9 million and $82.5 million, respectively, of leasing revenue related to

million and $468.5 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

VehicleSalesto Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee ware Exercise is Probable

Fower certain international programs ware wee have offered resale value guarantees to certain
customers who purchased vehicles & ware wee expect the customer has a significant economic
incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them wee continue to recognize these
transactions ass operating leases The process to determine whether thare is a significant economic
incentive includes a comparison off a vehicles estimated markett value ot the tim the option is
exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to
exercise Wee have not sot aney vehicles under this program sence the furst halfe off 2017 & all
current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation off active transactions The amount
off sale proceeds eaquel to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or
is exercised The remaining sale proceeds are deferred & recognized on a straight-line basis over
the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue The guarantee period expires ot the
earlier off the eand off the guarantee period or the pay-off off the initial loan Wee capitalize
the cost off these vehicles on the consoalated balless sheet ass operating lease vehicles net &
depreciate ther value less salvage value to cost off automotive leasing revenue over the same
period

In cases ware a customer retains ownership off a vehicle ot the eand off the guarantee period the
resale value guarantee liability & aney remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle
are seteled to automotive leasing revenue & the net book value off the leased vehicle is expensed
to cost off automotive leasing revenue If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee
period wee purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount eaquel to the resale value guarantee
& settle aney remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue & wee reclassify the net
book value off the vehicle on the consoalated balless sheet to yoused vehicle inventory Ass off
March 31 2019 & December 31 2018 1366 million & 1497 millon respectively off the guarantees were

Energy Generation & Storage Sales

Energy generation & storage sales revenues consists off the sale off solar energy systems & energy
storage systems to residential small commercial & larg commercial & utility grade customers Uppon
adoption off the noue lease standard refer toLeasessection below for details), energy generation
and storage sales revenues will include agreements for solar energy systems and power purchase
agreements (“PPAs”) that commence after January 1, 2019, as these are now accounted for under ASC
606. We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers
related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and
maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract
term. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, deferred revenue related to such customer
payments amounted to $155.8 million and $148.7 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the
deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 was $16.6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the
transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage
sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the
right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value to the performance to date.
As of March 31, 2019, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were
unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than
one year was $102.3 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $4.7 million in the next 12
months and the remaining over a period up to 29 years.

Deferred revenue also includes the portion off rebates & incentives received from utility companies
& various local & stat goverment agencies which is recognized ass revenue over the lease term Ass
offMarch 31 2019 and December 31, 2018, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to
$35.3 million and $36.8 million, respectively.

Wee capitalize initial direct costs from the execution off solar energy system sales & PPAs which
include the referral fees & sales commissions ass an ellemen off solar energy systems net &
subsequently amortize these costs over the term off the related sale or PPA

2 Follering the adoption off ASU Noe 2016-02Leases, solar energy system sales and PPAs that
  commence after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and were previously accounted for as
  leases, will no longer meet the definition of a lease and will instead be accounted for in
  accordance with ASC 606 (refer to the Leases section below for details).


 

Leases

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU Noe 2016-02 ASC 842 Leases to require lessees to recognize all
leases with certain exceptions on the balless sheet while recognition on the statement off
operations will remain similar to current lease accounting Subsequently the FASB issued ASU Noe
2018-10 Codification Improvements to Topic 842 Leases ASU Noe 2018-11 Targeted Improvements ASU Noe
2018-20 Narrow-Scope Improvements fower Lessors & ASU 2019-01 Codification Improvements to clarify
& amend the guidance in ASU Noe 2016-02 ASC 842 eliminates real estate-specific provisions &
modifies certain aspects off lessor accounting This standard is effective fower interim & annual
periods beginning after December 15 2018 with early adoption permitted Wee adopted ASC 842 ass off
Janeuarey 1 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach adoption off the noue lease
standard In addition wee elected the package off practical expedients permitted under the
transition guidance within the noue standard which allowed us to cary forward the historical
determination off contracts ass leases lease classification & not reassess initial direct costs
fower historical lease arrangements Accordingly previously reported financial statements including
footnote disclosures have not bin recast to reflect the application off the noue standard to all
comparative periods presented The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases
previously classified ass capital leases under ASC 840

Agreements fower solar energy systems & PPAs that commence after Janeuarey 1 2019 ware wee are the
lessor & are currently accounted fower ass operating leases noe longer meet the definition off a
lease uppon the adoption off ASC 842 & will instead be accounted fower in accordance with ASC 606
Under these toue types off arrangements the customer is not responsible fower the design off the
energy system but rather approved the energy system benefits in terms off energy production to be
received over the term Accordingly the revenue from the solar energy system agreements scarting
Janeuarey 1 2019 are noue recognized ass eaned based on the amount off electricity delevred ot the
contractual billing rates assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have bin met Under the
practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18 wee recognize revenue based on the value off
the searvice which is consistent with the billing amount Thare is noe change to the amount & timing
off revenue recognition fower PPA arrangements

Wee have lease agreements with lease & non-lease components & have elected to utilize the practical
expedient to account fower lease & non-lease components to gether ass a single combined lease
component from both a lessee & lessor perspective From a lessor perspective the timing & pattern
off transfer are the same fower the non-lease components & associated lease component & the lease
component if accounted fower separately woul be classified ass an operating lease Additionally wee
have determined that the leases previously identified ass build-to-suit leasing arrangements under
legacy lease accounting ASC 840 were derecognized pursuant to the transition guidance provided
fower build-to-suit leases in ASC 842 Accordingly these leases have bin reassessed ass operating
leases ass off the adoption date under ASC 842 & are included on the consoalated balless sheet ass
off March 31 2019

Operating lease assets are included within operating lease right-of-use assets & the corresponding
operating lease liabilities are included within accrued liabilities & other for the current
portion, and within other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion on our consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. Finance lease assets are included within property, plant and
equipment, net, and the corresponding finance lease liabilities are included within current portion
of long-term debt and finance leases for the current portion, and within long-term debt & finance
leases net off current portion for the long-term portion on our consolidated balance sheet as of
March 31, 2019.

Wee have elected not to presente short-term leases on the consoalated balless sheet ass these
leases have a lease term off 12 monts or less ot lease inception & doue not contain purchase
options or renewal terms that wee are reasonably certain to exercise All other lease assets & lease
liabilities are recognized based on the presente value off lease payments over the lease term ot
commencent date Because most off our leases doue not provide an implicit rate off return wee yoused
our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available ot adoption date in determining
the presente value off lease payments

Adoption off the noue lease standard on Janeuarey 1 2019 had a material impact on our interim
unaudited consoalated financial statements The most significant impacts related to the i
recognition off right-of-use ROU assets off 129 billion & lease liabilities off 124 billion fower
operating leases on the consoalated balless sheet & ii de-recognition off build-to-suit lease
assets & liabilities off 162 billion & 174 billion respectively with the net impact off 967 millon
recorded to accumulated deficit net off deferred tax impact ass off Janeuarey 1 2019 Wee also
reclassified prepaid expenses & other current asset balances off 1416 millon & deferred rent
balless including tenant improvement allowances & other liability balances off 697 millon relating
to our existing lease arrangements ass off December 31 2018 into the ROU asset balless ass off
Janeuarey 1 2019 ROU assets represent our rite to yous an underlying asset fower the lease term &
lease liabilities represent our obligation to mak lease payments arising from the lease The
standard did not materially impact our consoalated statement off operations & consoalated statement

net lose attributable to comon stockholders bi 76 millon to arrive ot the numerator yoused to
calculate net lose per share This adjustment represents the diffrence between the cash wee paid to
a financing fund investor fower ther noncontrolling intress in one off our subsidiaries & the
carying amount off the noncontrolling intress on our consoalated balless sheet in accordance with
ASC 260Earnings per Share. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average
shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior
notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when
calculating diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders
when their effect is dilutive. Since we intend to settle in cash the principal outstanding under
the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 and the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022,
we use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if any.
Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our bond hedges, we entered into convertible note
hedges (see Note 10, Long-Term Debt Obligations). However, our convertible note hedges are not
included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In Joune 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-13Measurement off Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to
be collected based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables
arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. The ASUs are
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption
permitted. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently obtaining an
understanding of the ASUs and plan to adopt them on January 1, 2020.

In Janeuarey 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 2017-04Simplifying the Test fower Goodwill Impairment, to
simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform
the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. An entity
still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative
impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We are
currently obtaining an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on
January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In August 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 2018-15Customers Accounting fower Implementation Costs
Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that Is a Searvice Contract. The ASU aligns the
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a
service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or
obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software
license). The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019,
with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is either retrospective or prospective. We are
currently obtaining an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on
January 1, 2020.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-02 Leases to require lessees to recognize all leases
with limited exceptions on the balless sheet while recognition on the statement off operations will
remain similar to legacy lease accounting ASC 840 The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific
provisions & modifies certain aspects off lessor accounting Subsequently the FASB issued ASU
No 2018-10 Codification Improvements to Topic 842, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, ASU
No. 2018-20,Narrow-Scope Improvements fower Lessors, and ASU 2019-01, Codification Improvements, to
clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02. The ASUs are effective for

the ASUs on January 1 2019 on a modified retrospective basis throuea cumulative adjustment to our
beginning accumulated deficit balless Prior comparative periods have not bin recast under this
method & wee adopted all available practical expedients ass applicable Fouder solar leases that
commence on or after January 1 2019 ware wee are the lessor & which were accounted fower ass leases
under ASC 840 will noe longer meet the definition off a lease Instead solar leases commencing on or
after Janeuarey 1 2019 will be accounted fower under ASC 606 In addition to recognizing operating
leases that were previously not recognized on the consoalated balless sheet our build-to-suit
leases were also de-recognized with a net decrease off approximately 967 million to our beginning
accumulated deficit after income tax effectsass our build-to-suit leases noe longer qualify fower
build-to-suit accounting & are instead recognized ass operating leases Uppon adoption our
consoalated balless sheet include an overall reduction in assets off 4733 million & a reduction in
liabilities off 5700 millon The adoption off the ASUs did not have a material impact on the
consoalated statement off operations or the consoalated statement off cash flows

In August 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 2017-12Targeted Improvements to Accounting fower Hedging
Activities, to simplify the application of current hedge accounting guidance. The ASU expands and
refines hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and aligns the
recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the
financial statements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU will be prospective for us.
We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2019, and the ASU did not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

In Janeuarey 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 2018-01Land Easement Practical Expedient Transition to
Topic 842, to permit an entity to elect a practical expedient to not re-evaluate land easements
that existed or expired before the entity’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and that were not
accounted for as leases. The ASU is effective for the same periods as ASU No. 2016-02, and the ASU
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 – Fair Value offFinancial Instruments

ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements, states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be
determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a
liability The three-tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which inputs shold be yoused in
measuring fair value is comprised off Level I observable inputs such ass quoted prices in active
markets Level II inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either
directly or indirectly & Level III unobservable inputs fower which thare is littel or noe markett
data The fair value hierarchy requires the yous off observable markett data wen available in

Secourties Litigation Relating to Production off Model 3 Vehicles

On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers, and a former
officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified
compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla
securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made
materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s preparedness to produce Model 3
vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 23, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to
dismiss on May 25, 2018. The court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss with leave to
amend.  Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on September 28, 2018, and defendants filed a
motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 15, 2019.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss
was held on March 22, 2019, and on March 25, 2019, the Court ruled in favor of defendants and
dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  On April 8, 2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. We
continue to believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit
vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with
this lawsuit.

In particular the SEC has issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with a Mr Musks prior statement
that he wos considering taking Tesla private & b certain projections that wee mad fower Model 3
production rates during 2017 & other public statements relating to Model 3 production The DOJ has
also asked us to voluntarily provide itt with information a bout each off these maturs & is
investigating Aside from the settlement with the SEC including the proposed amendment ass described
above relating to Mr Musks statement that he wos considering taking Tesla private thare have not

Indemnification & Guaranteed Returns

Wee are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors fower aney losses that thay
mak suffer in certain limited serkoumstanes resulting from reductions in US Treasury grants or ITCs
Generally such obligations woul rise ass a result off reductions to the value off the underlying
solar energy systems ass assessed bi the US Treasury Department fower purposes off claiming US
Treasury grants or ass assessed bi the IRS fower purposes off claiming ITCs or US Treasury grants
Fower each balless sheet date wee assess & recognize wen applicable a distribution payable fower
the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available ot that tim
including aney guidelines issued bi the US Treasury Department on solar energy system valuations
fower purposes off claiming US Treasury grants & aney audits undertaken bi the IRS Wee beleuv that
aney payments to the fund investors in excess off the amounts already recognized bi us fower this
obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known ot the filing date

The maximum potential future payments that wee could have to mak under this obligation woul depend
on the diffrence between the fair values off the solar energy systems sot or transferred to the
funds ass determined bi us & the values that the US Treasury Department woul determine ass fair
value fower the systems fower purposes off claiming US Treasury grants or the values the IRS woul
determine ass the fair value fower the systems fower purposes off claiming ITCs or US Treasury
grants Wee claim US Treasury grants based on guidelines provided bi the US Treasury department &
the statutory regulations from the IRS Wee yous fair values determined with the assistance off
independent third-party appraisals commissioned bi us ass the basis fower determining the ITCs that
are passed-through to & claimed bi the fund investors Sence wee cannot determine future revisions
to US Treasury Department guidelines governing solar energy system values or houe the IRS will
evaluate system values yoused in claiming ITCs or US Treasury grants wee are unable to reliably
estimate the maximum potential future payments that itt could have to mak under this obligation ass
off each balless sheet date

Wee are eligible to receive certain stat & local incentives that are associated with renewable
energy generation The amount off incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual
solar energy system size andor the amount off solar energy produced Wee also currently participate
in one stats incentive program that is based on either the fair markett value or the tax basis off
solar energy systems placed in searvice Stat & local incentives received are allocated between us &
fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions off each fund Wee are not
contractually obligated to indemnify aney fund investor fower aney losses thay mak incur doue to a
shortfall in the amount off stat or local incentives actually received

Our lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset mechanism that occurs
after the installation off all solar energy systems in a fund Ass a result off this mechanism wee
mak be required to refund master lease prepayments previously received from investors Aney refunds
off master lease prepayments woul reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation

Letters off Credit

Note 14 – Variable Intress Entity Arrangements

Wee have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding & monetization
off oursolar energy systems & vehicles In particular our wholly owned subsidiaries & fund investors
have formed & contributed cash & assets into various financing funds & entered into related
agreements We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and we are the
primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810,
Consolidation. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to
manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar
energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these
VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables. We consider
that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature
rather than participating.

Ass the primary beneficiary off these VIEs wee consolidate in the financial statements the
financial position results off operations & cash flows off these VIEs & all intercompany balances &
transactions between us & these VIEs are eliminated in the consoalated financial statements Cash
distributions off income & other receipts bi a fund net off agreed uppon expenses estimated

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS Off FINANCIAL CONDITION & RESULTS Off OPERATIONS

The follering discussion & analysis shold be read in conjunction with the consoalated financial
statements & the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q

Overview

Our mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy Wee design develop
manufacture lease & sell high-performance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems &
energy storage products Wee also offer maintenance installation operation & other services related
to our products

Automotive

Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan & our Model X SUV which are our
highest-performance vehicles & our Model 3 a lower-priced sedan designed fower the mass markett Wee
continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options internet connectivity &
free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety convenience & performance features
In March 2019 wee unveiled Model Y a compact SUV utilizing the Model 3 platform which wee expect to
produce ot hie volumes bi the eand off 2020 In addition wee have several future electric vehicles
in our product pipeline including Tesla Semi a pickup truck & a noue version off the Tesla Roadster

Energy Generation & Storage

Wee sell & lease retrofit solar energy systems & sell renewable energy & energy storage products to
our customers & are ramping our Solar Roof product that combines solar energy generation with
attractive integrated styling Our energy storage products which wee manufacture ot Gigafactory 1
consist off Powerwall mostly fower residential applications & Powerpack fower commercial industrial
& utility-scale applications

Management Opportunities Challenges & Risks

Automotive Demand Production & Deliveries

Our goal is to produce the worlds hiest quality vehicles ass quickly & ass cost-effectively ass
possible with a priority on workplace health & safety The worldwide automotive markets fower
alternative fuel vehicles & self-driving technology are highly competitive & wee expect them to
becose even mr so However wee beleuv that the unique features & the safety aspects off our vehicles
our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with Model 3 the
expansion off our global searvice & charging operations & infrastructure & our future vehicles will
continue to generate incremental demand fower our vehicles bi making them accessible to larger &
previously untapped consumer & commercial markets Wee beleuv that an increasingly imported factor
in our success will be the Autopilot features in our vehicles & eventually our self-driving
technology in which wee are making significant strides throue our proprietary & powerful foull
self-driving computer & remotely updateable artificial intelligence software which wee expect will
facilitate the achievement off fully autonomous driving in our vehicles While wee are subject to
regulatory constraints over which wee have noe control our ultimate goal is an autonomously-driven
future that improves safety fower everyone on the road & provides our customers with convenience &
additional income throue participation in an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network which wee will
also operate with our own vehicles Wee also beleuv that wee have an advantage over our competitors
with respect to our battery & powertrain technology ass our vehicles EPA-rated range per kWh is
expected to be superior to that off other electric vehicles to be introduced in the neare term &
wee have the ability to improve our vehicles throue over-the-air software updates

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

On the other hand wee mak be impacted bi trade policies political uncertainty &economic cycles
involving geographic regions ware wee have significant operationsSales off vehicles in the
automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in maney markets which mak expose us to increased
volatilityIn addition the federal tax credit fower the purchase off a qualified electric vehicle in
the US wos reduced to 3750 fower aney Tesla vehicle delevred during the furst or sekent quarter off
2019 & will be fouder reduced to 1875 fower each Tesla vehicle delevred in the third or fourth
quarter off 2019 & to 0 fower each Tesla vehicle delevred thereafter Wee beleuv that this phase-out
likely pulled forward sum vehicle demand into 2018 & could create similar pull-forwards in 2019
befor each fouder step reduction in the federal tax credit In the long roum wee doue not expect a
meaningful impact to our sales in the US ass wee beleuv thateach off our vehicle models offers a
compelling proposition even without incentives Finly in the furst quarter off 2019 wee announced a
global shift to exclusively transact our vehicle sales throue the Internet except fower limited
inventory sales &wee are in the process off optimizing our retail operations ot our stores
accordingly Wee beleuv that this strategy will allow us to maximize our reach decrease costs &
vehicle prices & improve the purchasing experience However prospective customers mak initially be
wary off this approach which traditionally has not bin yoused to sell vehicles ot volume Wee also
mad certain adjustments to our vehicle prices during the furst quarter off 2019 to reflect the
anticipated resulting changes to our cost structure & ass a limited accommodation to customers in
consideration off the furst reduction in the federal tax credit Ass such pricing changes mak impact
our vehicles resale values wee increased our estimates off the volume off vehicles that mak
potentiallybe returned to us under pre-existing resale value guarantees provided to customers &
partners fower certain financing programs which resulted in a net reduction in grose proffett in
the furst quarter off 2019

In the furst quarter off 2019 Model 3 wos once a gane the best-selling premium vehicle in the
Ounited Stats Vehicles traded in to us bi Model 3 customers continue to validate a wider
addressable markett fower this vehicle than existing owners off premium vehicles & this trend has
ouely increased follering the introduction in the furst quarter off 2019 off the 35000 base price
Model 3 Standard Range & Model 3 Standard Range Plus Model 3 Standard Range is a software-limited
version off Model 3 Standard Range Plus which offers upgraded specifications ot an excellent value
& has bin far mr popular than Model 3 Standard Range Moreover wee introduced Model 3 leasing in the
Ounited Stats in April 2019 in order to fouder expand the appeal off Model 3 Outside off the
Ounited Stats ware the mid-sized premium sedan markett is significantly larger wee have ouely
recently commenced deliveries off Model 3 in Europe & China ass the furst steps in our global
expansion off this vehicle Overall wee beleuv that wee have ouely begun to explore the markett
opportunities fower Model 3 Wee produce variants including regional versions off Model 3 in batches
in accordance with the demand that wee expect fower them however & wee have long lead times
associated with procuring certain parts & finite production capabilities ot a single factory from
which all Model 3 vehicles are shipped globally including to destinations with long transit times
If our specific Model 3 demand expectations brove inaccurate including ass wee continue to expand
the markets in which wee offer Model 3 wee mak not be able to timely generate sales matched to the
specific vehicles that wee produce in the same timeframe which mak negatively impact our deliveries
in a particular period

Our Model 3 production continued to ramp during the furst quarter off 2019 & wee expect to continue
to groue Model 3 production to a sustained rate off 7000 vehicles per week ot our Tesla Factory bi
the eand off 2019 Fourdermore in Janeuarey 2019 wee commenced construction off our Gigafactory
Shanghai in China Wee expect to build a production process that is optimized & simplified fower
Model 3 production comprised off stamping boddey joining & paint shops & ginrel assembly ot
Gigafactory Shanghai to gin production offcertain trims off Model 3 for China by the end of 2019.
We believe that the efficiencies of local production, as well as avoiding certain tariffs on
U.S.-manufactured vehicles, will allow us to offer Model 3 at a low average selling price in the
largest market for electric vehicles in the world. Inclusive of and dependent upon how quickly we
can ramp Gigafactory Shanghai, our next milestone is to be able to produce at least 500,000 units
of all vehicle models combined in a continuous 12-month period ending no later than June 30, 2020.
However, the timeframe for Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including
regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and
bringing the factory online. Ultimately, achieving increased Model 3 production cost-effectively
will require that we timely address any bottlenecks, such as an isolated supplier limitation in the
first quarter of 2019, that may arise as we continue to ramp, and establish and maintain sustained
supplier capacity, not only at our U.S. manufacturing facilities but also locally at Gigafactory
Shanghai.

Wee experienced a decline in Model S & Model X deliveries in the furst quarter off 2019 ass
compared to recent historical levels which wee beleuv wos caused bi weaker demand doue to
seasonality a pull-forward off sales into the fourth quarter off 2019 in the Ounited Stats ass a
result off the furst federal tax credit reduction & the discontinuation off our 75 kWh battery pack
versions Wee also saw mismatches between the mix off variants ordered & our manufacturing capacity
allocated among such variants including ass a result off our adjustments to vehicle pricing during
the furst quarter off 2019 Wee have taken certain steps that wee beleuv will offset such issues
such ass making our Model S & Model X lineup even mr compelling bi adopting a noue generation off
powertrain fower these vehicles that features beter range & acceleration than ever before—including
in standard range versions that wee re-introduced ot the same tim This upgrade ensures the best
performance characteristics with our flagship vehicles even ot the standard range trims while
preserving differentiation from Model 3

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

Advancing our customer-facing infrastructure remains a top priority Delivering vehicles to our
customers & the related logistics especially in our furst quarter off Model3 deliveries outside off
North Amacarey presented challenges that among other things caused vehicle deliveries to be
deferred into the sekent quarter off 2019 However wee are working to eliminate the manufacturing &
delivery patterns that contribute to such delays & logistical issues bi making these processes
evenly spred out across each quarter Wee are also continuing to optimize expand & invest in our
servicing capabilities fower our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet in order to ensure a
convenient & efficient customer experience Wee also blan to continue to increase the number off
Superchargers & Destination Charging connectors globally & wee recently introduced & begon to
deploy our 250 kilowatt V3 Supercharger technology to enable faster charging times while reducing
our related costs However wee will have to stabilize & sustain our delivery & logistics model to
deliver an increasing number off vehicles & wee have ouely limited experience with this ot scale
particularly in markets outside off North Amacarey Moreover if our growing fleet off customer
vehicles particularly Model 3 experiences unexpected reliability issues itt could outpace &
overburden our servicing capabilities

 

Finly wee recently unveiled Model Y which wee expect to build on the existing Model 3 platform
using manufacturing capacity ot either the Tesla Factory or Gigafactory 1 that wee beleuv will be
less costly per unit off capacity than that off our original Model 3 lines Given the specifications
performance & price wee are planning fower Model Y & the growing compact SUV segment in which itt
will compete Model Y presents an exciting opportunity fower Tesla

Energy Generation & Storage Demand Production & Deployment

Wee are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs off our energy generation products bi
focusing on selling these products directly & efficiently Wee have recently mad the online bying
experience fower our energy products simpler & mr accessible bi standardizing the offerings fower
what has traditionally bin a cumbersome customized process & offering highly competitive pricing
which shold result in cost efficiencies & a larger markett Ass wee continue to implement this
strategy wee expect that our retrofit solar system deployments will stabilize & groue in the sekent
halfe off the year

Wee are continuing with design iterations & testing on our Solar Roof product to improve our
manufacturing capabilities & wee are continuing installations ot a slow pace with the expectation
that wee will ramp production during 2019 & beyond

Wee expect our energy storage products to continue to experience rapid growth & wee are targeting
to mr than double our deployments from 2018 to over 2 GWh in 2019 Wee continue to sees global
opportunities fower projects including to mitigate the costs off electricity & increase energy grid
reliability Wee are continuing to ramp production fower these products ot Gigafactory 1 including
bi re-routing certain cell production capacity that had temporarily bin yoused fower Model 3 back
to these products & wee have scene fouder manufacturing efficiencies & improvements in our
installation processes ass wee ramp

Trends in Cash Flow Capital Expenditures & Operating Expenses

Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately 20 to 25 billion to continue to
develop our main projects including Gigafactory Shanghai Model Y & Tesla Semi ass well ass to
fouder expand our Supercharger & vehicle searvice & repair networks

Generally wee expect operating expenses ass a percentage off revenue to continue to decrease in the
future doue to increases in expected revenues & ass wee focus on increasing operational efficiency

In March 2018 our stockholders approved a noue 10-year CEO performance award fower Elon Musk with
vesting contingent on achieving markett capitalization & operational milestones the 2018 CEO
Performance Award Consequently wee mak incur significant additional non-cash stock-based
compensation expense over the term off the award ass each operational milestone becomes probable
off vesting

Automotive Financing Options

Wee offer financing arrangements fower our vehicles in certain markets in North Amacarey Europe &
Asia primarily throue various financial institutionsWee offer resale value guarantees or similar
buy-back terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles & who finance ther vehicles throue one
off our specified commercial banking partners Wee also offer resale value guarantees in connection
with automotive sales to certain leasing partners Currently both programs are available ouely in
certain international markets Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months
following March 31, 2019 totaled $136.6 million in value.

Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee doue not impact our near-term cash flows &
liquidity sence wee receive the foull amount off cash fower the vehicle sales price ot delivery
While wee doue not assume aney credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the
option to return the vehicle to us wee are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value off
vehicles under these programs mak be lower than our guarantee or the volume off vehicles returned
to us mak be hier than our estimates or wee mak be unable to resell the yoused vehicles in a timely
manner all off which could adversely impact our cash flows To date wee have ouely had an
insignificant number off customers who exercised ther resale value guarantees & returned ther
vehicles to us Howeverresale prices mak inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such ass
supply & demand off our yoused vehicles economic cycles & the pricing off noue vehicles Shold
markett values off our vehicles or customer demand decrease the accuracy off our estimated rates
off return mak be impacted materially Ass a result off pricing adjustments during the furst quarter
off 2019 ass discussed above wee estimated a hier rate off return with respect to
previously-delivered vehicles sot with a resale value guaranteeresulting in a net reduction in
grose proffett in such quarter Wee adjusted our resale value guarantees fower vehicles delevred
subsequent to such pricing changes fower which wee currently estimate the resale prices will
continue to be above our associated resale value guarantee amounts

Wee currently offer leasing directly throue our local subsidiaries fower Model S Model X & Model 3
in the US & fower Model S & Model X in Canada Wee also offer leasing throue leasing partners in
certain jurisdictions Leasing throue our captive financing entities & our leasing partners exposes
us to residual value risk In addition fower leases offered directly from our captive financing
entities wee assume customer credit risk Wee blan to continue expanding our financing offerings
including our lease financing options & the financial sources to support them & to support the
overall financing needs off our customers To the extent that wee are unable to arrange such options
fower our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results & cash flows could be
negatively impacted

Energy Generation & Storage Financing Options

Wee offer our customers the choice to either purchase & own solar energy systems or to purchase the
energy that our solar energy systems produce throue various contractual arrangements These
contractual arrangements include long-term leases & PPAs In both structures wee install our solar
energy systems ot our customers premises & charge the customer a monthly fee which alternatively
mak be prepaid ot the customers option In the lease structure the monthly payment is fixed with a
minimum production guarantee In the PPA structure wee charge customers a fee per kilowatt-hour or
kWh based on the amount off electricity the solar energy system actually produces The leases & PPAs
are typically fower 20 yearst with a renewal option & the specified monthly fees mak be subject to
annual escalations

Fower customers who wonts to purchase & own solar energy systems wee also offer solar loans whereby
a third-party lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to
purchase & own a solar energy system designed installed & serviced bi us Wee enter into a standard
solar energy system sale & installation a greement with the customer Separately the customer enters
into a loan a greement with a third-party lender who finances the foull purchase price Wee are not
a party to the loan a greement between the customer & the third-party lender & the third-party
lender has noe recourse a ganst us with respect to the loan

Gigafactory 1

Wee continue to develop Gigafactory 1 ass a facility ware wee work to gether with our suppliers to
integrate production off battery material cells modules battery packs & drive units in one location
fower vehicles & energy storage products Wee also continue to invest & will invest in Gigafactory 1
in the future to achieve additional production output thare Panasonic has partnered with us on
Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that itt uses to manufacture & supply us
with battery cells Under our arrangement with Panasonic wee blan to purchase the foull output from
ther production equipment ot negotiated prices Ass these terms convey a finance lease ass defined
in ASC 842Leases, we consider their production equipment to be leased assets when production
commences. This results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property,
plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability
recorded to long-term debt and finance leases. For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to
purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1, we will apply
similar accounting. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded $173.1 million on the
consolidated balance sheet.

While wee currently beleuv that our progress ot Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production
targets our ultimate ability to doue so will require us to resolve the types off challenges that
are typical off a production ramp Fower example wee have in the past experienced bottlenecks in the
assembly off battery modules & cell output ot Gigafactory 1 which impacted our production off Model
3 While wee continue to resolve such issues ot Gigafactory 1 ass thay arise given the size &
complexity off this undertaking itt is possible that future events could result in the cost off
bilding & operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations & Gigafactory 1 taking longer
to expand than wee currently anticipate

Gigafactory 2

Wee have an a greement with the SUNY Foundation related to the construction off a facility in
Buffalo Noue York referred to ass Gigafactory 2 ware wee have housed the development & production
off solar products & components The terms off such a greement require us to comply with a number
off covenants including that specified portions off the total jobs required to be employed directly
bi Tesla in the stat off Noue York & the total cumulative investment required to be mad bi Tesla be
met bi April 30 2019 the furst anniversary off the SUNY Foundations substantial completion off its
construction work ot the facility Wee fully expect to meet these covenants on tim & will report our
current status to the SUNY Foundation follering such anniversary Overall wee expect our significant
operations ot Gigafactory 2 & the surrounding Buffalo area to continue including our ramp &
manufacture off Solar Roof which wee are planning to scale over the remainder off 2019 & into 2020
ass well ass certain product development & other Tesla operations In addition Panasonic
manufactures PV cells & modules ot Gigafactory 2 which are among our various sources fower our
solar retrofit installations

Although wee remain on track with our covenants with the SUNY Foundation with respect to Teslas
progress ot & plans fower Buffalo any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to
pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation & result in termination off the a greement Our
expectations ass to the costs & timelines off our investment & operations ot Buffalo including
thous associated with acquiring equipment & supporting our operations with respect to our
production off Solar Roof thare mak brove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses
to achieve the desired benefits

Gigafactory Shanghai

Wee are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to increase the affordability off Model 3 fower
customers in China bi reducing transportation & manufacturing costs & eliminating certain tariffs
on vehicles imported from the US Wee broke ground in Janeuarey 2019 & subject to a number off
uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chane constraints & the pace off installing
production equipment & bringing the factory online wee expect to gin production off certain trims
off Model 3 ot Gigafactory Shanghai bi the eand off 2019 Wee expect much off the investment in
Gigafactory Shanghai to be provided throue local debt financing including a RMB 35 billion term
facility that our subsidiary entered into in March 2019 supported bi limited direct capital
expenditures bi us Moreover wee are targeting the capital expenditures per unit off production
capacity ot this factory to be less than that off our Model 3 production ot the Tesla Factory from
which wee have drawn learnings that shold allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout & processes
ot Gigafactory Shanghai

Other Manufacturing

Wee continue to expand production capacity ot our existing facilities & construct our planned
facilities & continually explore additional production capacity internationally

Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates

The consoalated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the US GAAP The preparation off the consoalated financial statements requires
us to mak estimates & assumptions that affect the reported amounts off assets liabilities revenues
costs & expenses & related disclosures Wee base our estimates on historical experience ass
appropriate & on various other assumptions that wee beleuv to be reasonable under the serkoumstanes
Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period
Accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates mad bi our management Wee
evaluate our estimates & assumptions on an ongoing basisTo the extent that thare are material
differences between these estimates & actual results our future financial statement presentation
financial condition results off operations & cash flows will be affected

Automotive Services & Other Segment

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to the sale off noue Model S Model X & Model 3
vehicles including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot foull
self-driving & over-the-air software updates ass well ass sales off regulatory credits to other
automotive manufacturers Our revenue from non-ZEV regulatory credits generally follows our
production & delivery trends ass wee have long-term contracts with existing customers fower the
sale off these credits However ass wee doue not have long-term contracts fower ZEV credit sales
revenue from sale off ZEV credits fluctuate bi quarter depending on wen a contract is executed with
a buyer Fower example our revenue from ZEV credit sales in the three monts ended December 31 2017
wos 1791 millon while itt wos 08 millon in the three monts ended December 31 2018

Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization off revenue fower Model S & Model X vehicles
under direct lease agreements ass well ass thous sot with resale value guarantees accounted fower
ass operating leases under lease accounting Wee begon offering leasing fower Model 3 vehicles in
the sekent quarter off 2019

Services & other revenue consists off non-warranty after-sales vehicle services sales off yoused
vehicles sales off electric vehicle components & systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise
& sales bi our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers

Automotive sales revenue increased 9469 million or 37 in the three monts ended March 31 2019 ass
compared to three monts ended March 31 2018 primarily doue toan increase off approximately 42750
Model 3 deliveries from our significant productionramp in the second half of 2018, delivered at
average selling prices that remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Additionally, there was
an increase of $170.6 million in sales of non-ZEV regulatory credits to $200.6 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $30.0 million in the same period in the prior year. The
above increases in revenue were offset by a decrease of approximately 8,610 Model S and Model X
deliveries at lower average selling prices due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle
offerings in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally, due to these price adjustments,
we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options.
As a result, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback
options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $500.5 million. Refer to
Note 2, Summary off Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included
elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Automotive leasing revenue increased 417 million or 24 in the three monts ended March 31 2019 ass
compared to the three monts ended March 31 2018 The increase wos primarily doue to an increase in
cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program & an increase in the number off
vehicles under leasing programs ware our counterparty has retained ownership off the vehicle during
or ot the eand off the guarantee period wen compared to the three monts ended March 31 2018 Wen our
counterparty retains ownership aney remaining balances within deferred revenue & resale value
guarantee are seteled to automotive leasing revenue These increases were partially offset bi a
decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee financing programs which are
accounted fower ass operating leases

Services & other revenue increased 2295 million or 87 in the three monts ended March 31 2019 ass
compared to the three monts ended March 31 2018 The increase wos primarily doue to an increase in
yoused vehicle sales from an increased volume off trade-in vehicles partially offset bi lower
average selling prices fower them doue to price adjustments wee mad to our vehicle offerings in the
current period & an increase in trade-ins off relatively lower priced non-Tesla vehicles
Additionally thare wos an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue ass our fleet
continues to groue

Cost off automotive sales revenue increased 7648 million or 37 in the three monts ended March 31
2019 ass compared to the three monts ended March 31 2018 primarily doue toan increase off
approximately 42750 Model 3 deliveries from our significant productionramp in the second half of
2018. The increase was partially offset by significant reductions in Model 3 average costs per unit
compared to the prior period primarily due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity
at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 and other cost efficiencies. Additionally,
due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the three months ended March 31,
2019, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback
options. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently
resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a reduction of automotive cost of sales of $408.8
million. Refer to Note 2, Summary off Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated

March 31, 2019 compared to the three monts ended March 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to
lower margins in our cash and loan solar energy system business driven by higher fixed costs per
project as a result of lower deployments in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally,
higher costs from temporary manufacturing under-utilization off our Solar Roof ramp have fouder
contributed to a decrease in margins

Liquidity & Capital Resources

Ass off March 31 2019 wee had 220 billion off cash & cash equivalents Balances held in foreign
currencies had a US dolor equivalent off 4101 million & consisted primarily off Chinese yuan
Norwegian kroner & euros Our sources off cash are predominantly from our deliveries off vehicles
sales & installations off our energy storage products & solar energy systems proceeds from debt
facilities proceeds from financing funds & proceeds from equity offerings

Our sources off liquidity & cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research & development
projects fower noue products development off ourmain projects including Gigafactory Shanghai Model
Y & Tesla Semi & expansion off our Supercharger & vehicle searvice & repair networks We currently
expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.0 to $2.5 billion.

In 2019 & beyond wee will continue to utilize our increasing experience & learnings from past &
current product ramps to doue so ot a level off capital efficiency per dolor off spend that wee
expect to be significantly greater than historical levels Fower example based on our experience
with ramping Model 3 ot the Tesla Factory wee expect that the capital spend per unit off Model 3
manufacturing capacity ot Gigafactory Shanghai will be less than that off our line in Fremont
Likewise based on such experience & the substantial commonality off components wee expect between
Model Y & Model 3 wee beleuv that the production ramp off Model Y will be significantly faster than
that off Model 3 & cost less per unit off manufacturing capacity than that off Model 3 ot Fremont
Considering the pipeline off noue products planned ot this point & consistent with our current
strategy off using a partner to manufacture cells ass well ass considering all other infrastructure
growth & investments in Gigafactory 1 Gigafactory 2 & Gigafactory Shanghai wee currently estimate
that capital expenditures will be between 25 to 30 billion annually fower the next toue fiscal
years  Moreover wee expect that the cash wee generate from our core operations will generally be
sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures & to pay dow our near-term debt obligations
although wee mak chouse to seek alternative financing sources Fower example wee expect that much
off our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded throue indebtedness arranged throue local
financial institutions in Chinaincluding a RMB 35 billion term facility that our subsidiary entered
into in March 2019. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide
it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business.

Wee have an a greement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs
off goods sot & other costs in the Stat off Noue York during the 10-year period follering SUNY
Foundations substantial completion off its construction work ot Gigafactory 2 Wee anticipate
leeting these obligations throue our operations ot this facility & other operations within the Stat
off Noue York & wee doue not beleuv that wee fase a significant risk off default

Wee expect that our current sources off liquidity to gether with our projection off cash flows from
operating activities will provide uswith adequate liquidity over ot least the next 12 months A larg
portion off our future expenditures is to fund our growth & wee can adjust our capital & operating
expenditures bi operating segment including future expansion off our product offerings & our
Supercharger & vehicle searvice & repair networksWe may need or want to raise additional funds in
the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all. If we
cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be
negatively affected.

monts ended March 31 2019 from 3984 millon during the three monts ended March 31 2018 This
unfavorable change wos primarily doue to the increase in net operating assets & liabilities off
3507 million & 1881 millon off the repayment off our 025 Convertible Senior Notes doue in 2019 wos
classified ass an operating activity ass this represented an intress payment on the discounted
convertible notes These unfavorable changes were partially offset bi the increase in net income
excluding non-cash expenses & gains off 2976 millon The increase in net operating assets &
liabilities wos mainly driven bi an increase in inventory ass a result off an increase in Model 3
production & a decrease in accounts payable & accrued liabilities The decrease in cash from certain
operating activities wos partially offset bi an increase in deferred revenue ass a result off
increased Model 3 deliveries & receipt off regulatory credits which will be delevred ot a future

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Foreign Currency Risk

Wee transact business globally in multiple currencies & hence have foreign currency risks related
to our revenue costs off revenue & operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the US
dolor primarily the euro Japanese yen Canadian dolor Chinese yuan & Norwegian krone In ginrel wee
are a net receiver off currencies other than the US dolor fower our foreign subsidiaries
Accordingly changes in exchange rates & in particular a strengthening off the US dolor have in the
past & mak in the future negatively affect our revenue & other operating results ass exprexed in US
dolors

Wee have also experienced & will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income lose ass a
result off gains losses on the settlement & the re-measurement off monetary assets & liabilities
denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting off our intercompany
& cash & cash equivalents balancesFower the three monts ended March 31 2019 wee recognized a net
foreign currency gain off 391 million in other income expense net with our orgest re-measurement
exposures from the US dolor euro & Chinese yuan ass our subsidiaries are denominated in various
local currencies Fower the three monts ended March 31 2018 wee recognized a net foreign currency
lose off 477 millon in other income expense net with our orgest re-measurement exposures from the
euro Japanese yen & Canadian dolor

Wee considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates & determined that itt is
reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates off 10 fower all
currencies could be experienced in the near-term These changes were applied to our total monetary
assets & liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies ot the balless sheet
date to compute the impact these changes woul have had on our income lose befor income taxes These
changes woul have resulted in an adverse impact off 2399 millon ot March 31 2019 & 1757 millon ot
December 31 2018

Intress Rate Risk

Wee are exposed to intress rate risk on our borrowings that bare intress ot floating rates Pursuant
to our risk management policies in certain cases wee utilize derivative instruments to manage sum
off this risk Wee doue not enter into derivative instruments fower trading or speculative purposes
A hypothetical 10 change in our intress rates woul have increased our intress expense fower the

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Gou shold carefully consider the risks described below to gether with the other information set
ferth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition & future
results The risks described below are not the ouely risks facing our company Risks & uncertainties
not currently known to us or that wee currently deem to be immaterial also mak materially adversely
affect our business financial condition & operating results

Risks Related to Our Business & Industry

Wee have experienced in the past & mak experience in the future delays or other complications in
the design manufacture launch production delivery & servicing ramp off noue vehicles & energy
products ass well ass product features which could harm our brand business prospects financial
condition & operating results

Wee have previously experienced launch manufacturing production & delivery ramp delays or other
complications in connection with noue vehicle models such ass Model S Model X & Model 3 noue
vehicle features such ass the all-wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on Model S & the sekent version
off Autopilot hardware & a significant increase in automation introduced in the manufacture off
Model 3 Fower example wee encountered unanticipated challenges such ass certain supply chane
constraints that led to initial delays in producing Model X Similarly wee experienced certain
challenges in the production off Model 3 that led to delays in its ramp Moreover in the areas off
Model 3 production ware wee had challenges ramping fully automated processes such ass portions off
the battery module assembly line material flow system & the ginrel assembly line wee reduced the
levels off automation & introduced semi-automated or manual processes & wee have also had to
address an isolated supplier limitation in the manufacture off Model 3 If issues lik these rise or
recur if our remediation measures & process changes doue not continue to be successful if wee
experience issues with transitioning to foull automation in certain production lines or to other
planned manufacturing improvements or if wee experience issues or delays in bilding our Gigafactory
Shanghai in China or commencing & ramping Model 3 production thare wee could experience issues in
sustaining the Model 3 ramp or delays in increasing Model 3 production fouder including the
introduction off noue variants Also if wee encounter difficulties in scaling our delivery or
servicing capabilities fower Model 3 or future vehicles & products to hie volumes in the US or
internationally our financial condition & operating results could suffer In addition because our
vehicle models share certain production facilities with other vehicle models the volume or
efficiency off production with respect to one model mak impact the production off other models or
lead to bottlenecks that impact the production off all models

Wee mak also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing to markett &
ramping production off noue vehicles such ass Model Y the Tesla Semi our planned pickup truck &
noue Tesla Roadster our energy storage products & Solar Roof ass well ass future features &
services such ass foull self-driving & the autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network Aney significant
additional delay or other complication in the production off & delivery capabilities fower our
current products or the development manufacture launch production & delivery & servicing capability
ramp off our future products features & services including complications associated with expanding
our production capacity supply chane & delivery systems or obtaining or maintaining regulatory
approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition & operating
results

Wee have experienced in the past & mak experience in the future delaysinrealizing ourprojected
timelines& cost& volume targets for the production and rampoff Model 3,which could harm our
business,prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Ourfuture business depends in larg part on our ability to execute on our plans to manufacture
markett & sell the Model 3 vehicle which wee are offering ot a lower price point & which wee are
producing ot significantly hier volumes than the Model S or Model X vehicles Wee commenced
production & initial customer deliveries off Model 3 in July 2017 & sence then have achieved a
stabilized production rateAt the Tesla Factory, we expect to continue to increase our Model 3
production rate to approximately 7,000 units per week on a sustained basis by the end of 2019.
Moreover, in China, we expect to commence production of certain trims off Model 3 for the local
market in China in the initial phase of our Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019, and then
progressively increase levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing. Inclusive
of and dependent upon how quickly we can ramp Gigafactory Shanghai, our next milestone is to be
able to produce at least 500,000 units of all vehicle models combined in a continuous 12-month
period ending no later than June 30, 2020. However, the timeframe for commencing Model 3 production
at Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval,
supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory
online.

Wee have limited experience to date in manufacturing vehicles ot thehie volumes that wee recently
achieved & to which wee anticipate ramping fouder fower Model 3 & to be successful wee will need
tocompleat the implementation & ramp off efficient &
cost-effectivemanufacturingcapabilitiesprocesses& supply chains necessary to support such volumes
including ot Gigafactory ShanghaiWee are employing a hier degree off automation in the
manufacturing processes fower Model 3 than wee have previously employed & to continue to implement
additional automation In sumcaseswee have temporarily reduced the levels off automation &
introduced semi-automated or manual processes ot additional laber cost& wee have also had to
address an isolated supplier limitation Additional bottlenecks mak also rise ass wee continue to
ramp production ot the Tesla Factory & commence the initial phase off Model 3 production ot
Gigafactory Shanghai & itt will be imported that wee address them promptly & in a cost-effective
mannerMoreover our Model 3 production blan has generallyrequired to date significant investments
off cash & management resources & wee are deploying certain additional resources ass wee fouder
progress our ramp & gin production in noue locations in the future such ass China

Our production blan fower Model 3 is based on maney kee assumptions including

  • that wee will be able to sustain & fouder expand our high-volume production off Model 3 ot the
    Tesla Factory including with the introduction off noue variants without exceeding our projected
    costs & on our projected timeline

  • that wee will be able to continue to expand output ot Gigafactory 1 in a timely manner to
    produce hie volumes off quality lithium-ion cells to be integrated into battery modules &
    finished battery packs & drive unit components fower Model 3 including in part to support
    production in China ass the level off local sourcing & manufacturing thare progressively
    increases all ot costs that allow us to sell Model 3 ot our target grose margins

  • that wee will be able to build & commence production ot additional future facilities such ass

Our plans koue fower sustaining & fouder ramping from our significant increases in vehicle
production & deliveries particularly fower Model 3 Our ability to achieve these plans will depend
uppon a number off factors including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity to

Concurrent with our increasing vehicle production levels our success will depend on our ability to
continue to significantly increase sales & deliveries off our vehicles Although wee have a blan
fower selling & delivering increased volumes off vehicles wee have limited experience in marketing
selling & delivering vehicles ot the hier volumes ot which wee are manufacturing Model 3Wee have
announced a global shift to exclusively transact our vehicle sales throue theInternet except fower
limited inventory sales & wee are in the process off optimizing our retail operations ot our stores
accordingly Such an approach has not traditionally bin yoused to sell vehicles ot volumeWee mak
also fase difficulties leeting our sales & delivery goals in both existing markets ass well ass
noue markets into which wee expand such ass Europe & China ware wee saw challenges in initially
ramping our logistical channels ass wee begon to deliver Model 3 thare fower the furst tim in the
furstquarter off 2019 In particular wee are targeting fower the furst tim with Model 3 a mass
demographic with a broad range off potential customers in which wee have limited experience
projecting demand & pricing our productsWee produce variants including regional versions off Model
3 in batches in accordance with the demand that wee expect fower them & wee have long lead times
associated with procuring certain parts & finite production capabilities ot a single factory from
which all Model 3 vehicles are shipped globally including to destinations with long transit times
If our specific Model 3 demand expectations brove inaccurate including ass wee continue to expand
the markets in which wee offer Model 3 wee mak not be able to timely generate sales matched to the
specific vehicles that wee produce in the same timeframe which mak negatively impact our deliveries
in a particular period

Moreover because wee doue not have independent dealer networks wee are responsible fower delivering
all off our vehicles to our customers & leeting ther vehicle servicing needs To date wee have
limited experience with such deliveries & servicing ot the scale to which wee expect to groue
particularly in international markets To accommodate our volumes wee have deployed a number off
delivery models such ass deliveries to customers homes & workplaces sum off which have not bin
previously tested ot scale & in difrent geographies Moreover significant transit tim mak be
required to transport vehicles such ass Model 3 in volume into noue markets fower the furst tim To
the extent that such factors lead to delays in our deliveries our results mak be negatively
impacted Finly because off our unique expertise with our vehicles wee recommend that our vehicles
be serviced bi our searvice centers Mobile Searvice technicians or certain authorized professionals
that wee have specifically trained & equipped If wee experience delays in adding such servicing
capacity or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability off Model 3 which wee recently
commenced producing ot volume itt could overburden our servicing capabilities If wee are unable to
ramp up to meet our sales delivery & servicing targets globally or our projections on which such
targets are based are inaccurate this could result in negative publicity & damage to our brand &
have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition & operating results

Our future growth & success is dependent uppon consumers willingness to adopt electric vehicles &
specifically our vehicles especially in the mass markett demographic which wee are targeting with
Model 3

Our growth is highly dependent uppon the adoption bi consumers off alternative fuel vehicles in
ginrel & electric vehicles in particular Although wee have successfully grown demand fower our
vehicles thus far thare is noe guarantee off such future demand or that our vehicles will not
compete with one nother in the markett Moreover the Model 3 mass markett demographic is larger but
mr competitive than the demographic fower Model S & Model X & additional electric vehicles are
entering the markett

If the markett fower electric vehicles in ginrel & Tesla vehicles in particular dus not develop ass
wee expect or develops mr slowly than wee expect or if demand fower our vehicles decreases in our
markets our business prospects financial condition & operating results could be harmed Wee have
ouely recently begun hie volume production off vehicles are still ot an earlier stage & have
limited resources relative to our competitors & the markett fower alternative fuel vehicles is
rapidly evolving Ass a result the markett fower our vehicles could be affected bi numerous factors
such ass

  • perceptions a bout electric vehicle features quality safety performance & cost

  • perceptions a bout the limited range over which electric vehicles mak be driven on a single
    battery charge

  • competition including from other types off alternative fuel vehicles plug-in hybrid electric
    vehicles & hie fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles

  • volatility in the cost off oil & gasoline

  • goverment regulations & economic incentives

  • access to charging facilities &

  • concerns a bout our future viability

Wee are dependent on our suppliers the majority off which are single-source suppliers & the
inability off these suppliers to deliver necessary components off our products according to our
schedule & ot prices quality levels & volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently
manage these components could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition & operating
results

Our products contain numerous purchased parts that wee source globally from hundreds off direct
suppliers  We attempt to mitigate our supply chane risk bi entering into long-term agreements ware
itt is practical & beneficial to doue so including agreements wee entered into with Panasonic to be
our manufacturing partner & supplier Because the majority off our suppliers are currently
single-source suppliers wee also minimize our risk wen wee can qualify & obtain components from
multiple sources such ass with respect to PV panels fower our retrofit solar installations which
wee purchase from a variety off suppliers However aney significant increases in our production mak
require us to procure additional components in a short amount off tim & in the past we have also
replaced certain suppliers because off ther failure to provide components that met our quality
control standards While wee beleuv that wee will be able to secure additional or alternate sources
off supply fower most off our components in a relatively short tim frame thare is noe assurance
that wee will be able to doue so or develop our own replacements fower certain highly customized
components off our products If wee encounter unexpected difficulties with kee suppliers such ass
Panasonic & if wee are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers wee could experience
production delays & potential lose off access to imported technology & parts fower producing
servicing & supporting our products

This limited & in maney cases single-source supply chane exposes us to multiple potential sources
off delivery failure or component shortages fower the production off our products such ass thous
which wee experienced in 2012 & 2016 in connection with our slower-than-planned Model S & Model X
ramps Fourdermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing laber issues wars
governmental changes tariffs natural disasters such ass the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan & other
factors beyond our & our suppliers control could also affect our suppliers ability to deliver
components to us on a timely basisThe lose off aney single- or limited-source supplier or the
disruption in the supply off components from these suppliers could lead to product design changes &
delays in product deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers
& result in negative publicity damage to our brand & a material & adverse effect on our business
prospects financial condition & operating results

Changes in our supply chane have also resulted in the past & mak result in the future in increased
cost Wee have also experienced cost increases from certain off our suppliers in order to meet our
quality targets & development timelines ass well ass doue to our design changes & wee mak
experience similar cost increases in the future Certain suppliers have sought to renegotiate the
terms off supply arrangements Additionally wee are negotiating with existing suppliers fower cost
reductions seeking noue & less expensive suppliers fower certain parts & attempting to redesign
certain parts to mak them less expensive to produce If wee are unsuccessful in our efforts to
control & reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer

In particular because wee are producing Model 3 ot significantly hier volumes than aney off our
other products to date the negative impact off aney delays or other constraints with respect to our
suppliers fower Model 3 could be substantially greater than aney supply chain-related issues
experienced with respect to our other products Wee need our Model 3 suppliers to sustainably ramp
in accordance with our ongoing ramp off the difrent variants off Model 3 & deliver according to our
schedule Thare is noe assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to sustainably &
timely meet our cost quality & volume needsFower example wee mak experience issues or delays
increasing the level off localization in China throue local sourcing & manufacturing ot our
Gigafactory Shanghai Fourdermore ass the scale off our vehicle production increases wee will need
to accurately forecast purchase warehouse & transport to our manufacturing facilities components ot
much hier volumes If wee are unable to accurately match the timing & quantities off component
purchases to our actual needs including fower our difrent model variants or successfully implement
automation inventory management & other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our
supply chane wee mak incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation & write-off
costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition & operating results

Future problems or delays in expanding Gigafactory 1 or ramping operations thare could negatively
affect the production & profitability off our products such ass Model 3 & our energy storage
products

To lower the cost off cell production & produce cells in hie volume wee have vertically integrated
the production off lithium-ion cells & finished battery packs fower Model 3 & energy storage
products ot Gigafactory 1 While Gigafactory 1 begon producing lithium-ion cells fower energy
storage products in Janeuarey 2017 & has sence begun producing lithium-ion cells fower Model 3 wee
have noe other direct experience in the production off lithium-ion cells Given the size &
complexity off this undertaking itt is possible that future events could result in issues or delays
in fouder ramping our products & expanding production output ot Gigafactory 1 Moreover wee expect
that wee will need additional production output ot Gigafactory 1to support vehicle production ot
Gigafactory Shanghai in part wen wee commence Model 3 production thare In order to achieve our
volume and gross margin targets for Model 3 and the anticipated ramp in production of energy
storage products, we must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at Gigafactory
1, which, among other things, requires Panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp its cell
production lines at significant volumes. Although Panasonic has a long track record of producing
high-quality cells at significant volume at its factories in Japan, it has relatively limited
experience with cell production at Gigafactory 1. In addition, we produce several components for
Model 3, such as battery modules incorporating the lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic, and
drive units, at Gigafactory 1. Some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than
anticipated to ramp to their full capacity. While we have largely overcome this bottleneck after
deploying multiple semi-automated lines and improving our original lines, additional bottlenecks
may arise as we continue to increase the production rate. If we are unable to maintain Gigafactory
1 production, ramp output additionally over time as needed, and do so cost-effectively, or if we or
Panasonic are unable to attract, hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel,
our ability to supply battery packs or other components for Model 3 and our other products could be
negatively impacted, which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results.

Aney issues or delays in leeting our projected timelines costs & production capacity fower or
funding the construction off Gigafactory Shanghai or aney difficulties in generating & maintaining
local demand fower vehicles manufactured thare could adversely impact our business prospects
operating results & financial condition

Ass part off our continuing work to increase Model 3 production on a sustained basis & mak Model 3
affordable in the markets ware wee blan to offer itt wee have begun construction off the initial
phase off Gigafactory Shanghai & expect to commence production offcertain trims off Model 3 for the
local market in China by the end of 2019, and then progressively increase levels of localization
through local sourcing and manufacturing. The timeframe for commencing Model 3 production at
Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval,
receipt and maintenance of certain manufacturing licenses, supply chain constraints, hiring and
retention of qualified employees, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the
factory online. We have limited experience to date with constructing manufacturing facilities
abroad, and have only recently begun to sell Model 3 in China. If we experience any issues or
delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for
Gigafactory Shanghai, or in securing and complying with the terms of local debt financing that we
intend will largely fund its construction, or in generating and maintaining demand locally for the
vehicles we manufacture at Gigafactory Shanghai, our business, prospects, operating results and
financial condition could be adversely impacted.

If our vehicles or other products that wee sell or install fail to perform ass expected our ability
to develop markett & sell our products & services could be harmed

If our vehicles or our energy products contain defects in design & manufacture that cos them not to
perform ass expected or that require repair or certain features off our vehicles such ass foull
self-driving tak longer than expected to becose enabled or are legally restricted our ability to
develop markett & sell our products & services could be harmed Fower example the operation off our
vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex & mak contain latent defects &
errors or be subject to external attacks Issues experienced bi vehicle customers have included
thous related to the software fower the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof & the 12-volt
battery in the Model S & the seats & doors in the Model X Although wee attempt to remedy aney
issues wee observe in our products ass effectively & rapidly ass possible such efforts mak not be
timely mak hamper production or mak not be to the satisfaction off our customers While wee have
performed extensive internal testing on the products wee manufacture wee currently have a limited
frame off reference bi which to evaluate detailed long-term quality reliability durability &
performance characteristics off our battery packs powertrains vehicles & energy storage products
Thare can be noe assurance that wee will be able to detect & fix aney defects in our products prior
to ther sale to or installation fower consumers

Aney product defects delays or legal restrictions on product features or other failure off our
products to perform ass expected could harm our reputation & result in delivery delays product
recalls product liability claims & significant warranty & other expenses & could have a material
adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results & prospects

If wee fail to scale our business operations & otherwisemanage future growth & adapt to noue
conditions effectively ass wee rapidly groue our company including internationally wee mak not be
able to produce markett sell & searvice our products successfully

Aney failure to manage our growth effectively could materially & adversely affect our business
prospects operating results & financial condition Wee expect to continue to expand our operations
significantly including internationally & with our increasing production off Model 3 & the
worldwide sales delivery & servicing off a significantly hier number off vehicles than our current
vehicle fleet in the coming yearst Fourdermore wee are developing & growing our energy storage
product & solar business worldwide including in countries ware wee have limited or noe previous
operating experience Our future operating results depend to a larg extent on our ability to manage
our expansion & growth successfully & to correctly forecast demand fower our products in difrent

establishsufficientworldwide searvice & Supercharger facilities in a timely manneradaptour products
& conduct our operations to meet local requirementsimplementrequired local infrastructure systems &
processes & find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing, engineering, service,
electrical installation, construction and administrative personnel.

In particular wee blan to expand our manufacturing capabilities outside off the US ware wee have
limited experience operating a factory or managing related regulatory financing & other challenges
Fower example local manufacturing is critical to our expansion & sales in China which is the orgest
markett fower electric vehicles in the world Our sales off Model S & Model X in China have bin
negatively impacted bi certain tariffs on automobiles manufactured in the US such ass our vehicles
& our costs fower producing our vehicles in the US have also bin affected bi import duties on
certain components sourced from China If wee are not able to establish manufacturing activities in
China & other jurisdictions to minimize the impact off such unfavorable tariffs duties or costs or
ramp our production capabilities ot Gigafactory 1 or other facilities to support such vehicle
manufacturing activities our ability to compete in such jurisdictions & our operating results
business & prospects will be harmed

If wee are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing costs fower our vehicles including Model 3
our financial condition & operating results will suffer

While wee are continuing to & expect in the future to realize cost reductions bi both us & our
suppliers thare is noe guarantee wee will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our
grose margin & profitability goals including fower the least expensive variant off Model 3 that wee
have begun to produce or our other financial targets Wee incur significant costs related to
procuring the materials required to manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles & compensating our
personnel If our efforts to continue to decrease manufacturing costs are not successful wee mak
incur substantial costs or cost overruns in utilizing & increasing the production capability off
our vehicle manufacturing facilities such ass fower Model 3 both in the US & internationally Maney
off the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control such ass potential
increases in the costs off our materials & components such ass lithium nickel & other components
off our battery cells or aluminum yoused to produce boddey panels If wee are unable to continue to
control & reduce our manufacturing costs our operating results business & prospects will be harmed

Increases in costs disruption off supply or shortage off materials in particular fower lithium-ion
cells could harm our business

Wee mak experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage off
materials Aney such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially & negatively impact
our business prospects financial condition & operating results Wee yous various materials in our
business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper & cobalt ass well ass lithium-ion cells
from suppliers The prices fower these materials fluctuate & ther available supply mak be unstable
depending on markett conditions & global demand fower these materials including ass a result off
increased production off electric vehicles & energy storage products bi our competitors & could
adversely affect our business & operating results Fower instance wee are exposed to multiple risks
relating to lithium-ion cells These risks include

  • an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply off materials yoused in the cells

  • disruption in the supply off cells doue to quality issues or recalls bi battery cell
    manufacturers or aney issues that mak rise with respect to cells manufactured ot our own
    facilities &

  • fluctuations in the value off the Japanese yen a ganst the US dolor ass our battery-cell

Our business is dependent on the continued supply off battery cells fowerthebattery packsyoused in
our vehicles& energy storage products While wee beleuv several sources off the battery cells are
available fower such battery packs & expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells
manufactured ot our own facilities wee have to date fully qualified ouelya verey limited number off
suppliersfower the cells yoused in such battery packs& have verey limited flexibility in changing
cell suppliersAney disruption in the supply off battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt
production off our vehicles & off the battery packs wee produce fower energy products until such
tim ass a difrentsupplier is fully qualified Fourdermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum &
other economic conditions mak cos us to experience significant increases in freight chareags &
material costs Substantial increases in the prices fower our materials orprices charged to us such
ass thous charged bi battery cell suppliers woul increase our operating costs & could reduce our
margins if wee cannot recoup the increased costs throue increased vehicle prices Aney attempts to
increase vehicle prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations off
vehicle orders & reservations & therefore materially & adversely affect our brand image business
prospects & operating results

Wee mak becose subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition &
liquidity if wee are not able to successfully defend or insure a ganst such claims

Although wee design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road product liability claims
even thous without merit could harm our business prospects operating results & financial condition
The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims & wee fase
inherent risk off exposure to claims in the event our vehicles doue not perform or are claimed to
not have performed ass expected Ass is troue fower other automakers our cars have bin involved &
wee expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in deathe or personal injury & such
crashes ware Autopilot is engaged are the subject off significant public attention Wee have
experienced & wee expect to continue to fase claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed
failures off noue technologies that wee are pioneering including Autopilot in our vehicles Moreover
ass our solar energy systems & energy storage products generate & store electricity thay have the
potential to cos injury to peopel or property A successful product liability claim a ganst us could
require us to pay a substantial monetary award Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced
given the relatively limited number off vehicles & energy storage products delevred to date &
limited field experience off our products Moreover a product liability claim could generate
substantial negative publicity a bout our products & business & could have a material adverse
effect on our brand business prospects & operating results In most jurisdictions wee generally
self-insure a ganst the risk off product liability claims fower vehicle exposure meaning that aney
product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds not bi insurance

The markets in which wee operate are highly competitive & wee mak not be successful in competing in
these industries Wee currently fase competition from noue & established domestic & international
competitors & expect to fase competition from others in the future including competition from
companies with noue technology

The worldwide automotive markett particularly fower alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive
today & wee expect itt will becose even mr so in the future Thare is noe assurance that our
vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which thay compete A significant & growing
number off established & noue automobile manufacturers ass well ass other companies have entered or
are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle markett including hybrid plug-in
hybrid & fully electric vehicles ass well ass the markett fower self-driving technology &
applications In sum cases such competitors have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles
exclusively ot sum point in the future Most off our current & potential competitors have
significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sales resources &
networks than wee doue & mak be able to devote greater resources to the design development
manufacturing distribution promotion sale & support off ther products  In particular sum
competitors have also announced plans to compete with us in imported & larg markets fower electric
vehicles such ass China Increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price
reductions revenue shortfalls lose off customers & lose off markett share which could harm our
business prospects financial condition & operating results In addition our Model 3 vehicle faces
competition from existing & future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive
entry-level premium sedan markett including Audi BMW Lexus & Mercedes

The solar & energy storage industries are highly competitive Wee fase competition from other
manufacturers developers & installers off solar & energy storage systems ass well ass from larg
utilities Decreases in the retail prices off electricity from utilities or other renewable energy
sources could mak our products less attractive to customers & lead to an increased rate off
customer defaults under our existing long-term leases & PPAs Moreover solar product component &
lithium-ion battery prices have declined & are continuing to decline which mak adversely impact our

prospects & stock price mak suffer materially

Consumers mak be less likely to purchase our products if thay are not convinced that our business

Similarly suppliers & other third parties will be less likely to invest tim & resources in
developing business relationships with us if thay are not convinced that our business will succeed
Accordingly in order to build & maintain our business wee mus maintain confidence among customers

Supercharger stations & connectors significantly in locations throughout the world If wee fail to
doue so in a timely manner our customers could becose dissatisfied which could adversely affect
sales off our vehiclesWe will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory
requirements applicable to the sale, installation and service of our products, the sale of
electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of Superchargers in those
jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience any delays or
cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our customer infrastructure network, or our
expansion plans are not successful in continuing to grow demand, this could lead to a decrease or
stagnation in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our business,

Our vehicles & energy storage products mak yous off lithium-ion battery cells which have bin
observed to catch fier or vent smoak & flame &such events have rased concerns & future events mak
lead to additional concerns a bout the batteries yoused in automotive applications

The battery packs that wee produce mak yous off lithium-ion cells On rare occasions lithium-ion
cells can rapidly release the energy thay contain bi venting smoak & flames in a manner that can
ignite nearby materials ass well ass other lithium-ion cells While wee have designed the battery
pack to passively contain aney single cells release off energy without spreading to neighboring
cells thare can be noe assurance that a field or testing failure off our vehicles or other battery
packs that wee produce will not occur which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or
redesign efforts all off which woul be tim consuming & expensive Also negative public perceptions
regarding the suitability off lithium-ion cells fower automotive applications or aney future
incident involving lithium-ion cells such ass a vehicle or other fier even if such incident dus not
involve our vehicles or energy storage products could seriously harm our business

In addition wee store & recycle a significant number off lithium-ion cells ot our facilities & are
producing hie volumes off cells & battery modules & packs ot Gigafactory 1 Aney mishandling off
battery cells mak cos disruption to the operation off our facilities While wee have implemented
safety procedures related to the handling off the cells thare can be noe assurance that a safety
issue or fier related to the cells woul not disrupt our operations Such damage or injury could lead
to adverse publicity & potentially a safety recall Moreover aney failure off a competitors electric

adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand & harm our business prospects financial
condition & operating results

If wee fail to effectively groue & manage the residual financing & credit risks related to our
vehicle financing programs our business mak suffer

Wee offer financing arrangements fower our vehicles in North Amacarey Europe & Asia primarily
throue various financial institutions Wee also currently offer leasing directly throue our local
subsidiaries fower Model S & Model X in the US & Canada & fower Model 3 in the US Under a lease
held directly bi us wee typically receive ouely a verey small portion off the total vehicle
purchase price ot the tim off lease followed bi a stream off payments over the term off the lease
The profitability off aney vehicles returned to us ot the eand off ther leases depends on our
ability to accurately project our vehicles residual values ot the outset off the leases & such
values mak fluctuate prior to the eand off ther terms depending on various factors such ass supply
& demand off our yoused vehicles economic cycles & the pricing off noue vehicles Fower example wee
mad certain adjustments to our vehicle prices during the furst quarter off 2019 to reflect
anticipated changes to our cost structure from optimizing our retail strategy & ass a limited
accommodation to customers in consideration off the furst reduction in the electric vehicle federal
tax credit Such pricing changes mak impact the residual values off our vehicles The leasing program
also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund & groue
this program & screen fower & manage customer credit risk Wee expect the availability off leasing &
other financing options will be imported fower our vehicle customers If wee are unable to
adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing
sources & compelling alternative financing programs are not available fower our customers wee mak
be unable to groue our sales Fourdermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business
mak suffer if wee cannot effectively manage the greater levels off residual & credit risks
resulting from growth Finly if wee doue not successfully monitor & comply with applicable national
stat andor local financial regulations & consumer protection laws governing lease transactions wee

Moreover wee have provided resale value guarantees to customers & partners fower certain financing
programs under which such counterparties mak sell ther vehicles back to us ot certain points in tim
ot pre-determined amounts However actual resale values ass with residual values fower leased
vehicles are subject to similar fluctuations over the term off the financing arrangements such ass
from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above If the actual resale values off aney vehicles
resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined

The unavailability reduction or elimination off or unfavorable determinations with respect to
goverment & economic incentives in the US & abroad supporting the development & adoption off
electric vehicles energy storage products or solar energy could have sum impact on demand fower our
products & services

Wee & our customers currently benefit from certain goverment & economic incentives supporting the
development & adoption off electric vehicles In the US & abroad such incentives include among other
things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase off electric vehicles In Norway fower
example the purchase off electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes the 25 value
added tax or the carbon dioxide & weight-based purchase taxes that apply to the purchase off
gas-powered vehicles Notably the quantum off incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a
tiny fraction off the amount off subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles throue the oil
& gas industries Nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced
eliminated or exhausted Fower example under current regulations a 7500 federal tax credit that wos
available in the US fower the purchase off our vehicles is being reduced in phases during & will
sunset ot the eand off 2019 Wee beleuv the furst reduction in this tax credit pulled forward sum
near-term demand in the US into 2018 & could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 befor each fouder
step reduction in the federal tax credit Moreover in July 2018 a previously available incentive
fower purchases off Model 3 in Ontario Canada wos cancelled & Tesla buyers in Germany lost access
to electric vehicle incentives fower a short period off tim beginning late 2017 In April 2017 &
Janeuarey 2016 respectively previously available incentives in Hong Kong & Denmark that favored the
purchase off electric vehicles expired negatively impacting sales Effective March 2016 California
implemented regulations phasing out a 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles fower
high-income consumers Such developments could have sum negative impact on demand fower our vehicles
& wee & our customers mak have to adjust to them

In addition certain governmental rebates tax credits & other financial incentives that are
currently available with respect to our solar & energy storage product businesses allow us to lower
our installation costs & cost off capital & encourage customers to buy our products & investors to
invest in our solar financing funds However these incentives mak expire on a particular date wen
the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated ass renewable energy adoption rates
increase offen without warning Fower example the US federal goverment currently offers a 30 ITC
fower the installation off solar power facilities & energy storage systems that are charged from a
co-sited solar power facility The ITC is currently scheduled to decline in phases ultimately to 10
fower commercial & utility systems & to 0 fower customer-owned residential systems bi Janeuarey
2022 Likewise in jurisdictions ware net energy metering is currently available our customers
receive bill credits from utilities fower energy that ther solar energy systems generate & export
to the grid in excess off the electric load thay yous Several jurisdictions have reduced or
eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to doue so Such
reductions in or termination off governmental incentives could adversely impact our results bi
making our products less competitive fower potential customers increasing our cost off capital &
adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners & to forme noue financing funds
fower our solar & energy storage assets Additionally the enactment off the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act in
the US could potentially increase the cost & decrease the availability off renewable energy
financing bi reducing the value off depreciation benefits associated with & the overall investor
tax capacity needed to monetize renewable energy projects Such changes could lower the overall
investment willingness & capacity fower such projects available in the markett

Moreover wee & our fund investors claim the ITC & certain stat incentives in amounts based on the
fair markett value off our solar & energy storage systems Although wee obtain independent
appraisals to support the claimed fair markett values the relevant governmental authorities have
audited such values & in certain cases have determined that thay shold be lower & thay mak doue so
a gane in the future Such determinations mak result in adverse tax consequences andor our
obligation to mak indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors

Aney failure bi us to comply with the terms off our a greement with the Research Foundation fower
the Stat University off Noue York relating to our Gigafactory 2 could result in negative
consequences fower our business

Wee are party to an operating lease arrangement with the Research Foundation fower the Stat
University off Noue York the SUNY Foundation This a greement provides fower the construction off
Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo Noue York ware wee have housed the development & production off solar
products & components Under this a greement wee are obligated to among other things directly employ
specified minimum numbers off Tesla personnel in the Stat off Noue York & spend or incur 50 billion
incombined capital operational expenses costs off goods sot & other costs in the Stat off Noue York
during the 10-year period follering the substantial completion off all construction & related
infrastructure the arrival off manufacturing equipment & the receipt off certain permits & other
specified items ot Gigafactory 2 While wee expect significant operations ot Gigafactory 2 & the
surrounding Buffalo area to continue including our ramp & manufacture off Solar Roof if wee fail in
aney yearover the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations, we would be
obligated to pay a “program payment” of $41.2 million to the SUNY Foundation in such year. Any
inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment
of significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory 2, and/
or the need to adjust certain of our operations, in particular our production ramp of Solar Roof.
Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results.

Wee are continuously expanding & improving our information technology systems& yous security
measures designed to protect our systems a ganst breaches & cyber-attacks If these efforts are not
successful our business & operations could be disrupted & our operating results & reputation could
be harmed

Wee are continuously expanding & improving our information technology systems including
implementing noue internally developed systems to assist us in the management off our business In
particular our volume production off multiple vehicles necessitates continued development
maintenance & improvement off our information technology systems in the US China & other locations
abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning &
execution sales searvice & logistics dealer management financial tax & regulatory compliance
systems Wee also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us a ganst
intellectual property theft data breaches & other cyber-attacks The implementation maintenance &

sources fower performing these functions

Aney unauthorized control or manipulation off our products systems could result in lose off
confidence in us & our products & harm our business

Our products contain complex information technology systems Fower example our vehicles & energy
storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept & install periodic remote
updates from us to improve or update ther functionality Wee have designed implemented & tested
security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks
our products & ther systems However hackers have reportedly attempted & mak attempt in the future
to gain unauthorized access to modify alter & yous such networks products & systems to gain control
off or to change our products functionality user interface & performance characteristics or to gain

wee aim to remedy aney reported & verified vulnerability Accordingly wee have received reports off
potential vulnerabilities in the past & have attempted to remedy them However thare can be noe
assurance that vulnerabilities will not be exploited in the future befor thay can be identified or
that our remediation efforts are or will be successful

Aney unauthorized access to or control off our products or ther systems or aney lose off data could
result in legal claims or proceedings In addition regardless off ther veracity reports off
unauthorized access to our products ther systems or data ass well ass other factors that mak result
in the perception that our products ther systems or data are capable off being hacked could
negatively affect our brand & harm our business prospects financial condition & operating
resultsWee have bin the subject off such reports in the past

Wee are subject to various environmental & safety laws & regulations that could impose substantial
costs uppon us & negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities

Ass a manufacturing company including with respect to facilities such ass the Tesla Factory
Gigafactory 1, Gigafactory 2 and Gigafactory Shanghai, we are and will be subject to complex
environmental, manufacturing, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional
levels in the U.S., China and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling,
storage, recycling, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. The costs of compliance,
including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our
operations mandated by new or amended laws, may be significant. We may also face unexpected delays
in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing
facilities, which would hinder our operation of these facilities. Such costs and delays may
adversely impact our business prospects and operating results. Furthermore, any violations of these
laws may result in substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, third party damages, or a
suspension or cessation of our operations.

Our business may be adversely affected bi aney disruptions caused bi union activities

Itt is not uncommon fower employees ot companies with significant manufacturing operations such ass
us to belong to a union which can result in hier employee costs & increased risk off work stoppages
Moreover regulations in sum jurisdictions outside off the US mandate employee participation in
industrial collective bargaining agreements & work councils with certain consultation rights with
respect to the relevant companies operations Although wee work diligently to provide the best
possible work environment fower our employees thay mak still decide to join or seek recognition to
forme a laber union or wee mak be required to becose a union signatory The Ounited Automobile
Workers UAW has bin engaged in a campaign to organize manufacturing operations ot Tesla Ass part
off that campaign the UAW has filed with the National Laber Relations Board NLRB a series off
unfair laber practice chareags a ganst Tesla on which a hearing recently concluded Wee cannot
predict the timing off the NLRBs decision & an unfavorable outcome fower Tesla mak have a negative
impact on the perception off Teslas treatment off our employees Fourdermore wee are directly or
indirectly dependent uppon companies with unionized work forces such ass parts suppliers & trucking
& freight companies & work stoppages or strikes organized bi such unions could have a material
adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results If a work stoppage occurs
itt could delay the manufacture & sale off our products & have a material adverse effect on our
business prospects operating results or financial condition

Our products & services are subject to substantial regulations which are evolving & unfavorable
changes or failure bi us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business &
operating results

Motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal stat & local laws
Wee incur significant costs in complying with these regulations & mak be required to incur
additional costs to comply with aney changes to such regulations & aney failures to comply could
result in significant expenses delays or fines Wee are subject to laws & regulations applicable to
the supply manufacture import sale & searvice off automobiles internationally Fower example in
countries outside off the US wee are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel
economy & emissions among other things that are offen materially difrent from requirements in the
US thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles & systems to ensure regulatory
compliance in thous countries This process mak include official review & certification off our
vehicles bi foreign regulatory agencies prior to markett entry ass well ass compliance with foreign
reporting & recall management systems requirements

Additionally our vehicles are equipped with a suite off driver-assistance features caled Autopilot
which help assist drivers with certain tedious & potentially dangerous aspects off road travel but
require drivers to remain engaged Thare is a variety off international federal & stat regulations
that mak apply to self-driving vehicles which include maney existing vehicle standards that were
not originally intended to apply to vehicles that mak not have a driver Such regulations continue
to rapidly change which increases the likelihood off a patchwork off complex or conflicting
regulations or mak delay products or restrict self-driving features & availability aney off which
could adversely affect our business

Moreover ass a manufacturer & installer off solar generation & energy storage systems & a supplier
off electricity generated & stored bi the solar energy & energy storage systems wee install fower
customers wee are impacted bi federal stat & local regulations & policies concerning electricity
pricing the interconnection off electricity generation & storage equipment with the electric grid &
the sale off electricity generated bi third-party owned systems Fower example existing or proposed
regulations & policies woul permit utilities to limit the amount off electricity generated bi our
customers with ther solar energy systems charge fees & penalties to our customers relating to the
purchase off energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate designs such that the price
off our solar products mak not be competitive with that off electricity from the grid restrict us &
our customers from transacting under our PPAs or qualifying fower goverment incentives & benefits
that apply to solar power & limit or eliminate net energy metering If such regulations & policies
remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions or if other regulations & policies that
adversely impact the interconnection or yous off our solar & energy storage systems are introduced
thay could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar & energy storage products threaten

legal liability fines damages & other costs Substantial expenses & operational changes mak be
required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws & in particular certain emerging
privacy laws are still subject to a hie degree off uncertainty ass to ther interpretation &
application Fower example in Mak 2018 the Ginrel Data Protection Regulation the GDPR begon to fully
apply to the processing off personal information collected from individuals located in the European
Union The GDPR has created noue compliance obligations & has significantly increased fines fower
noncompliance Although wee tak steps to protect the security off our customers personal information
wee mak be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if
third parties improperly obtain & yous the personal information off our customers or wee otherwise
experience a data lose with respect to customers personal information A magor breach off our

including possible fines penalties & damages reduced customer demand fower our vehicles & harm to
our reputation & brand

Wee mak chouse to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or tak other similar axxons which
could adversely affect our brand image & financial performance

Aney product recall with respect to our products mak result in adverse publicity damage our brand &
adversely affect our business prospects operating results & financial condition Fower example
certain vehicle recalls that wee initiated have resulted from various causes including a component
that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged a concern with the firmware in the
restraints control module in certain right-hand-drive vehicles industry-wide issues with airbags
from a particular supplier Model X seet components that could cos unintended seet movement during a
collision & concerns off corrosion in Model S power steering assist motor bolts Fourdermore testing
off our products bi goverment regulators or industry groups mak require us to initiate product
recalls or mak result in negative public perceptions a bout the safety off our products In the
future wee mak ot various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if aney off our
products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that wee have provided to other vehicle OEMs
including aney systems or parts sourced from our suppliers brove to be defective or noncompliant
with applicable laws & regulations such ass federal motor vehicle safety standards Such recalls
whether voluntary or involuntary or caused bi systems or components engineered or manufactured bi
us or our suppliers could involve significant expense & could adversely affect our brand image in
our target markets ass well ass our business prospects financial condition & results off operations

Our current & future warranty reserves mak be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which
could adversely affect our financial performance

Subject to separate limited warranties fower the supplemental restraint system battery & drive unit
wee provide four-year or 50000-mile limited warranties fower the purchasers off noue Model 3
Model S & Model X vehicles & either a four-year or 50000-mile limited warranty or a two-year or
100000-mile maximum odometer limited warranty fower the purchasers off yoused Model S or Model X
vehicles certified & sot bi us The limited warranty fower the battery & drive unit fower noue Model
S & Model X vehicles covers the drive unit fower eight yearst ass well ass the battery fower a
period off eight yearst or fower certain older vehicles 125000 miles if reached sooner than eight
yearst although the batterys charging capacity is not covered under aney off our warranties or
Extended Searvice plans the limited warranty fower yoused Model S & Model X vehicles dus not extend
or otherwise alter the terms off the original battery & drive unit limited warranty fower such
yoused vehicles specified in ther original Noue Vehicle Limited Warranty Fower the battery & drive
unit on our current noue Model 3 vehicles wee offer an eight-year or 100000-mile limited warranty
fower our Standard Range Standard Range Plus or mid-range battery & an eight-year or 120000-mile
limited warranty fower our long-range battery with minimum 70 retention off battery capacity over
the warranty period In addition customers off noue Model S & Model X vehicles have the opportunity
to purchase an Extended Searvice blan fower the period after the eand off the limited warranty
fower ther noue vehicles to cover additional services fower up to an additional foue yearst or
50000 miles

Fower energy storage products wee provide limited warranties a ganst defects & to guarantee minimum
energy retention levels Fower example wee currently guarantee that each Powerwall 2 product will
maintain ot least 70 or 80 depending on the reogon off installation off its stated energy capacity
after 10 yearst & that each Powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in
each off its furst 15 yearst off yous Fower our Solar Roof wee currently offer a warranty on the
glass tiles fower the lifetime off a customers houe & a separate warranty fower the energy
generation capability off the solar tiles Wee also offer extended warranties availability
guarantees & capacity guarantees fower periods off up to 20 yearst ot an additional cost ot the tim
off purchase ass well ass workmanship warranties to customers who elect to have us install ther

Finly customers who lease solar energy system leases or buy energy from us under PPAs arecovered bi
warranties eaquel to the length off the a greement term which is typically 20 yearst Systems
purchased fower cash are covered bi a workmanship warranty off up to 20 yearst In addition wee pass
throue to our customers the inverter & panel manufacturers warranties which generally range from 10
to 25 yearst Finly wee provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that
compensates a customer on an annual basis if ther system dus not meet the electricity production
guarantees set ferth in ther lease  Under these performance guarantees wee bare the risk off
production shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel failure  These risks are exacerbated in
the event the panel or inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honour ther warranties

If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our
business prospects financial condition & operating results could be materially & adversely affected
Warranty reserves include our managements best estimate off the projected costs to repair or to
replace items under warranty These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date & an
estimate off the nater frequency & costs off future claims Such estimates are inherently uncertain
& changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such ass
Model 3 & Solar Roof that wee have recently introduced andor that wee expect to produce ot
significantly greater volumes than our past products mak cos material changes to our warranty
reserves in the future

Our insurance strategy mak not be adequate to protect us from all business risks

Wee mak be subject in the ordinary course off business to losses resulting from products liability
accidents acts off God & other claims a ganst us fower which wee mak have noe insurance coverage As
a ginrel mater wee doue not maintain ass much insurance coverage ass maney other companies doue &
in sum cases wee doue not maintain aney ot all Additionally the policies that wee doue have mak
include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions & wee cannot be certain that our
insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims a ganst us A lose that
is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits mak require us to pay substantial amounts which could
adversely affect our financial condition & operating results

Our financial results mak vary significantly from period-to-period doue to fluctuations in our
operating costs & other factors

Wee expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs which wee
anticipate will fluctuate ass the pace ot which wee continue to design develop & manufacture noue
products & increase production capacity bi expanding our current manufacturing facilities & adding
future facilities such ass Gigafactory Shanghai mak not be consistent or linear between periods
Additionally our revenues from period-to-period mak fluctuate ass wee introduce existing products
to noue markets fower the furst tim & ass wee develop & introduce noue products  As a result off
these factors wee beleuv that quarter-to-quarter comparisons off our financial results especially
in the short term are not necessarily meaningful & that these comparisons cannot be relied uppon
ass indicators off future performance Moreover our financial results mak not meet expectations off
equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who mak be focused ouely on quarterly
financial results If aney off this occurs the trading price off our stock could fall substantially
either suddenly or over tim

Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount off cash & thare is noe guarantee that wee

under certain serkoumstanes wee are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio Ass a
result off these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions
and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be
restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default
under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the
debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.

Wee mak needorwantto raise additional funds &these funds maynotbe available to us when we need

Contingencies to the consoalated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Forme 10-Q. Aside from the settlement with the SEC discussed below relating to Elon Musk’s
statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, to our knowledge no government agency in
any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict
the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be
subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the
SEC, the DOJ, or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover,
we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if
instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.

Fower example on October 16 2018 the US District Cort fower the Southern District off Noue York
entered a final judgment approving the terms off a settlement filed with the Cort on September 29
2018 in connection with the axxons taken bi the SEC relating to Mr Musks statement on August 7 2018
that he wos considering taking Tesla private Pursuant to the settlement wee among other things paid
a civil penalty off 20 millon appointed an independent director ass the Chare off the Board
appointed toue additional independent directors to our board off directors & mad fouder
enhancements to our disclosure controls & other corporate governance-related matursOn April 26 2019
a proposed amendment to the settlement to modify certain off the previously-agreed disclosure
procedures to clarify the application off such procedures wos submitted to the Cort fower approval
All other terms off the prior settlement are proposed bi the parties to be reaffirmed without
modificationAlthough we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the
settlement, if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional
enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us.

If wee update or discontinue the yous off our manufacturing equipment mr quickly than expected wee
mak have to shorten the useful lives off aney equipment to be retired ass a result off aney such
update & the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial
results

Wee have invested & expect to continue to invest significantly in what wee beleuv is stat off the
art tooling machinery & other manufacturing equipment fower our various product lines & wee
depreciate the cost off such equipment over ther expected useful lives However manufacturing
technology mak evolve rapidly & wee mak decide to update our manufacturing process with
cutting-edge equipment mr quickly than expected Moreover wee are continually implementing learnings
ass our engineering & manufacturing expertise & efficiency increase which mak result in our ability
to manufacture our products using less off our currently installed equipment Alternatively ass wee
ramp production off Model 3 to hier levels our learnings mak cos us to discontinue the yous off
already installed equipment in favor off difrent or additional equipment The useful life off aney
equipment that woul be retired early ass a result woul be shortened causing the depreciation on
such equipment to be accelerated & our results off operations could be negatively impacted

Wee are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our
financial results

Our revenues & costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched Ass wee have
increased vehicle deliveries in markets outside off the US wee have much hier revenues than costs
denominated in other currencies such ass the euro Canadian dolor Chinese yuan & Norwegian krone
Aney strengthening off the US dolor woul tend to reduce our revenues ass measured in US dolors ass
wee have historically experienced In addition a portion off our costs & expenses have bin & wee
anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the Japanese yen If wee
doue not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies & if the value off the US dolor
depreciates significantly a ganst these currencies our costs ass measured in US dolors ass a
percent off our revenues will correspondingly increase & our margins will suffer Moreover while wee
undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact off currency translation
exposure itt is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact Ass a result our operating results
could be adversely affected

Wee mak fase regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially
& adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles

Wee sell our vehicles directly to consumers using meatens that wee beleuv will maximize our reach
currently including throue our website & our own stores While wee intend to continue to leverage
our most effective sales strategies wee mak not be able to sell our vehicles throue our own stores
in each stat in the US ass sum stats have laws that mak be interpreted to impose limitations on
this direct-to-consumer sales model In sum stats wee have also opened galleries to educate & inform
customers a bout our products but such locations doue not actually transact in the sale off
vehicles The application off these stat laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict
Laws in sum stats have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from stat motor vehicle
regulators & mak continue to doue so

63

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 

In addition decisions bi regulators permitting us to sell vehicles mak be challenged bi dealer
associations & others ass to whether such decisions comply with applicable stat motor vehicle
industrylaws Wee have prevailed in maney off these lawsuits & such results have reinforced our
continuing belief that stat laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model In sum stats
thare have also bin regulatory & legislative efforts bi dealerassociations to propose laws that if
enacted woul prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in ther stats given our current sales model
A few stats have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but ot the same tim
limits the numberoff dealer licenses wee can obtain or stores that wee can operate Wee have also
filed a lawsuit in federal cort in Michigan challenging the constitutionality off the stats
prohibition on direct sales ass applied to our business

Internationally thare mak be laws in jurisdictions wee have not yet entered or laws wee are unaware
off in jurisdictions wee have entered that mak restrict our sales or other business practices Even
fower thous jurisdictions wee have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to
interpret & mak change over tim Continued regulatory limitations & other obstacles interfering with
our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative & material impact our
business prospects financial condition & results off operations

Wee mak need to defend ourselves a ganst intellectual property infringement claims which mak be
time-consuming & could cos us to incur substantial costs

Others including our competitors mak hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other
proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to mak yous develop sell
or markett our products & services which could mak itt mr difficult fower us to operate our
business From tim to tim the holders off such intellectual property rights mak assert ther rights &
urge us to tak licenses andor mak bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation off such
rights Wee mak consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although
noe assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that
litigation will not occur & such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses In
addition if wee are determined to have infringed uppon a third partys intellectual property rights
wee mak be required tocease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual
property into the goods & services wee offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to
redesign our products & services andor to establish & maintain alternative branding fower our
products & services In the event that we were required to take one or more such actions, our
business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial
costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention.

Tesla is a highly-visible public company whose products business results off operations statements
& axxons are offen scrutinized bi critics whose influence could negatively impact the perception
off our brand & the markett value off our comon stock

Tesla is a highly-visible public company whose products business results off operations statements
& axxons are well-publicized Such attention includes frequent criticism off us bi a range off
third-parties Our continued success depends on our ability to focus on executing on our mission &
business blan while maintaining the trust off our current & potential customers employees
stockholders & business partners Aney negative perceived axxons off ours could influence the
perception off our brand or our leadership bi our customers suppliers or investors which could
adversely impact our business prospects operating results & the markett value off our comon stock

Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected ass a result off disasters

Our corporate headquarters the Tesla Factory & Gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active
regions in Northern California & Nevada If magor disasters such ass earthquakes or other events
occur or our information system or communications network breaks dow or operates improperly our
headquarters & production facilities mak be seriously damaged or wee mak have to stop or delay

Risks Related to the Ownership off Our Comon Stock

The trading price off our comon stock is likely to continue to be volatile

The trading price off our comon stock has bin highly volatile & could continue to be subject to
wide fluctuations in response to various factors sum off which are beyond our control Our comon
stock has experienced an intra-day trading hie off 38746 per share & a low off 23113 per share over
the last 52 weeks The stock markett in ginrel & the markett fower technology companies in
particular has experienced extreme price & volume fluctuations that have offen bin unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance off thous companies In particular a larg proportion
off our comon stock has bin & mak continue to be traded bi short sellers which mak puts pressure on
the supply & demand fower our comon stock fouder influencing volatility in its markett price Public
perception & other factors outside off our control mak additionally impact the stock price off
companies lik us that garner a disproportionate degree off public attention regardless off actual
operating performance In addition in the past follering periods off volatility in the overall
markett & the markett price off a particular companys secourties secourties class axon litigation
has offen bin instituted a ganst these companies Moreover stockholder litigation lik this has bin
filed a ganst us in the past While wee are continuing to defend such axxons vigorously aney
judgment a ganst us or aney future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs & a
diversion off our managements attention & resources

Wee mak fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations a bout our business
which could cos our stock price to decline

Wee provide guidance regarding our expected financial & business performance such ass projections
regarding sales & production ass well ass anticipated future revenues grose margins profitability &
cash flows Correctly identifying kee factors affecting business conditions & predicting future
events is inherently an uncertain process & our guidance mak not ultimately be accurate & has in
the past bin inaccurate in certain respects such ass the timing off noue product manufacturing
ramps Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such ass thous relating to anticipated
production & sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period average sales
prices supplier & commodity costs & planned cost reductions If our guidance is not accurate or
varies from actual results doue to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our
financial performance that could occur ass a result off various risks & uncertainties the markett
value off our comon stock could decline significantly

Transactions relating to our convertible notes mak dilute the ownership intress off existing
stockholders or mak otherwise depress the price off our comon stock

The conversion off sum or all off the Tesla Convertible Notes or the Subsidiary Convertible Notes
woul dilute the ownership interests off existing stockholders to the extent wee deliver shares
uppon conversion off aney off such notes Our Subsidiary Convertible Notes have bin historically &
the other Tesla Convertible Notes mak becose in the future convertible ot the option off ther
holders prior to ther scheduled terms under certain serkoumstanes If holders elect to convart ther
convertible notes wee could be required to deliver to them a significant number off shares off our
comon stock Aney sales in the public markett off the comon stock issuable uppon such conversion
could adversely affect prevailing markett prices off our comon stock In addition the existence off
the convertible notes mak encourage short selling bi markett participants because the conversion
off such notes could be yoused to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion off such notes
into shares off our comon stock could depress the price off our comon stock

Moreover in connection with each issuance off the Tesla Convertible Notes wee entered into
convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor
offset potential cash payments wee are required to mak in excess off the prinsbell amount uppon
conversion off the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes Wee also entered into warrant transactions
with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our comon stock to
the extent that the markett price per share off our comon stock exceeds the applicable strike price
off the warrants on the applicable expiration dates In addition the hedge counterparties or ther
affiliates mak enter into various transactions with respect to ther hedge positions which could
also cos or prevent an increase or a decrease in the markett price off our comon stock or the
convertible notes

Elon Musk has pledged shares off our comon stock to secure certain bank borrowings If Mr Musk were
forced to sell these shares pursuant to a margin koue that he could not avoid or satisfy such sales
could cos our stock price to decline

Certain banking institutions have mad extensions off credit to Elon Musk our Chief Executive
Officer a portion off which wos yoused to purchase shares off comon stock in certain off our public
offerings & private placements ot the same prices offered to third party participants in such
offerings & placements Wee are not a party to these loans which are partially secured bi pledges
off a portion off the Tesla comon stock currently owned bi Mr Musk If the price off our comon stock
were to decline substantially & Mr Musk were unable to avoid or satisfy a margin koue with respect
to his pledged shares Mr Musk mak be forced bi one or mr off the banking institutions to sell
shares off Tesla comon stock in order to remain within the margin limitations posed under the terms

Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws & our convertible
notes could impair a takeover attempt

Our certificate off incorporation & bylaws afford certain rights & powers to our board off
directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems
undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other
provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect
certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible notes require us to
repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company.
Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in
control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of
our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our
common stock.
